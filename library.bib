  abstract = {Genomic prediction and genome-wide association studies are becoming widely employed in potato key performance trait QTL identifications and to support potato breeding using genomic selection. Elite cultivars are tetraploid and highly heterozygous but also share many common ancestors and generation-spanning inbreeding events, resulting from clonal propagation of potatoes through seed potatoes. Consequentially, many SNP markers are not in 1:1 relationship with a single allele variant but shared over several alleles that might exert varying effects on a given trait. The impact of such redundant 'diluted' predictors on the statistical models underpinning GWAS and genomic prediction have scarcely been evaluated, despite the potential impact on model accuracy and performance. We evaluated the impact of marker location, -type, and -density on genomic prediction and GWAS of five key performance traits in tetraploid potato (chipping quality, dry matter content, length/width ratio, senescence, and yield). A 762 offspring panel of a diallel cross of 18 elite cultivars was genotyped-by-sequencing, and markers were annotated according to a reference genome. Genomic prediction models (GBLUP) were trained on four marker subsets (non-synonymous [29,553 SNPs], synonymous [31,229], non-coding [32,388], and a combination) and robustness to marker reduction was investigated. Single-marker regression GWAS was performed for each trait and marker subset. Best cross-validated prediction correlation coefficients of 0.54, 0.75, 0.49, 0.35, and 0.28 were obtained for chipping quality, dry matter content, length/width ratio, senescence, and yield, respectively. Trait prediction abilities were similar across all marker types, only non-synonymous variants improving yield predictive ability by 16 \%. Marker reduction response did not dependent on marker type but rather on trait. Traits with high predictive abilities, e.g. dry matter content, reached a plateau using fewer markers than for traits with intermediate-low correlations, such as yield. Predictions were unbiased across all traits, marker types, and all marker densities {$>$} 100 SNPs. Our results suggest using non-synonymous variants does not enhance performance of genomic prediction of most traits. Major known QTLs were identified by GWAS and were reproducible across exonic and whole-genome variant sets for dry matter content, length/width ratio, and senescence. In contrast, minor QTLs detection was marker type dependent.},

  abstract = {There is an ongoing endeavor within the potato breeding sector to rapidly adapt potato from a clonal polyploid crop to a diploid hybrid potato crop. While hybrid breeding allows for the efficient generation and selection of parental lines, it also increases breeding program complexity and results in longer breeding cycles. Over the past two decades, genomic prediction has revolutionized hybrid crop breeding through shorter breeding cycles, lower phenotyping costs, and better population improvement, resulting in increased genetic gains for genetically complex traits. In order to accelerate the genetic gains in hybrid potato, the proper implementation of genomic prediction is a crucial milestone in the rapid improvement of this crop. The authors of this paper set out to test genomic prediction in hybrid potato using current genotyped material with two alternative models: one model that predicts the general combining ability effects (GCA) and another which predicts both the general and specific combining ability effects (GCA+SCA). Using a training set comprising 769 hybrids and 456 genotyped parental lines, we found that reasonable a prediction accuracy could be achieved for most phenotypes with both zero common parents (ρ = 0.36 − 0.61) and one (ρ = 0.50 − 0.68) common parent between the training and test sets. There was no benefit with the inclusion of non-additive genetic effects in the GCA+SCA model despite SCA variance contributing between 9\% and 19\% of the total genetic variance. Genotype-by-environment interactions, while present, did not appear to affect the prediction accuracy, though prediction errors did vary across the trial’s targets. These results suggest that genomically estimated breeding values on parental lines are sufficient for hybrid yield prediction.},

Several genes have been identified that influence seed size by acting maternally, such as AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR2, APETALA2, and DA1. However, given the lack of gain-of-function effects of these genes on seed size, it is unclear whether their activity levels are limiting in WT plants and whether they could thus be used to regulate seed size in development or evolution. Also, whether the altered seed sizes reflect local gene activity or global physiological changes is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the cytochrome P450 KLUH (KLU) regulates seed size. KLU acts locally in developing flowers to promote seed growth, and its activity level is limiting for seed growth in WT. KLU is expressed in the inner integument of developing ovules, where it non-cell autonomously stimulates cell proliferation, thus determining the growth potential of the seed coat and seed. A KLU-induced increase in seed size leads to larger seedlings and higher relative oil content of the seeds.

It is also one of the richest vegetable sources of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and has successfully been used in poultry diets to fortify chicken eggs with omega-3 PUFA. Both linseed and its oil can be used in hen’s diets to produce omega-3 eggs which are available in super markets under various brand names. The use of linseed in commercial layer diets is limited mainly due to the presence of potential antinutritional factors which can compromise production performance and egg quality in laying hens if fed at too high of a level. However, linseed oil can be used to produce omega 3–enriched eggs without any detrimental effect on hen performance. Therefore, linseed oil is the preferred feed ingredient to use in laying hen diets to produce omega 3–enriched eggs which can bring a premium price at retail.},

  abstract = {Linseed is a rich source of energy, protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, and some antioxidants. It is also one of the richest vegetable sources of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and has successfully been used in poultry diets to fortify chicken eggs with omega-3 PUFA. Both linseed and its oil can be used in hen’s diets to produce omega-3 eggs which are available in super markets under various brand names. The use of linseed in commercial layer diets is limited mainly due to the presence of potential antinutritional factors which can compromise production performance and egg quality in laying hens if fed at too high of a level. However, linseed oil can be used to produce omega 3–enriched eggs without any detrimental effect on hen performance. Therefore, linseed oil is the preferred feed ingredient to use in laying hen diets to produce omega 3–enriched eggs which can bring a premium price at retail.},

The lines were genotyped with 1,152 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Pedigree data were available for three generations.

Average prediction accuracies based on genomic data were high even for a complex trait like grain yield (0.72-0.74) when the cross-validation scheme allowed for a high degree of relatedness between the estimation and the test set. When predictions were performed across distantly related families, prediction accuracies decreased significantly (0.47-0.48). Prediction accuracies decreased with decreasing sample size but were still high when the population size was halved (0.67-0.69).

A wide range of crossing schemes are possible including large biparental crosses, backcrosses, four-way crosses, and synthetic populations. In silico progeny simulations together with genome-based prediction of quantitative traits can be used to guide mating decisions. However, the large number of multi-parental combinations can hinder the use of simulations in practice. Analytical solutions have been proposed recently to predict the distribution of a quantitative trait in the progeny of biparental crosses using information of recombination frequency and linkage disequilibrium between loci. Here, we extend this approach to obtain the progeny distribution of more complex crosses including two to four parents. Considering agronomic traits and parental genome contribution as jointly multivariate normally distributed traits, the usefulness criterion parental contribution (UCPC) enables to (i) evaluate the expected genetic gain for agronomic traits, and at the same time (ii) evaluate parental genome contributions to the selected fraction of progeny. We validate and illustrate UCPC in the context of multiple allele introgression from a donor into one or several elite recipients in maize (Zea mays L.). Recommendations regarding the interest of two-way, three-way, and backcrosses were derived depending on the donor performance. We believe that the computationally efficient UCPC approach can be useful for mate selection and allocation in many plant and animal breeding contexts.},

  abstract = {Most wild and cultivated diploid potato species are self-incompatible, preventing inbreeding and promoting outcrossing. To generate diploid inbred lines, the tuber bearing self-compatible species Solanum chacoense (M6 line) has been used to overcome self-incompatibility. In this study, self-compatibility was introgressed from a set of four diploid self-compatible (SC) donor lines with S. chacoense background into eight introgression species lines to develop a multi-species potato germplasm pool using a recurrent selection (RS) breeding strategy. Concurrently, tuber and adaptation-related traits were selected under Michigan field conditions prior to self-compatibility assessment. After six cycles of RS, we observed a significant increase in self-compatibility (16\% in cycle 0–86\% in cycle 5) inheritance and improvement of tuber-related traits. Reproductive fitness was increased, reducing male sterility from 32\% in cycle 0 to 0\% in cycle 5. Progeny with no-flowers decreased from 19 to 3\% from RS cycles 0 to cycle 5. Additionally, 4,885 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) markers were used to access the linkage disequilibrium (LD), heterozygosity, and population structure over the RS population. SNP heterozygosity moderately decreased through the six cycles of RS cycles. Hierarchical clustering and Principal Components Analysis showed that selections become more uniform as the cycles advanced and that LD had been reduced across each potato chromosome. We observed significant increase in earliness for vine maturity in cycle 4. The SC germplasm developed in this study can be used to introgress self-compatibility, select tuber-related traits, and develop inbred lines in F1 hybrid programs using a genetically diverse diploid germplasm.},

  abstract = {Most wild and cultivated diploid potato species are self-incompatible, preventing inbreeding and promoting outcrossing. To generate diploid inbred lines, the tuber bearing self-compatible species Solanum chacoense (M6 line) has been used to overcome self-incompatibility. In this study, self-compatibility was introgressed from a set of four diploid self-compatible (SC) donor lines with S. chacoense background into eight introgression species lines to develop a multi-species potato germplasm pool using a recurrent selection (RS) breeding strategy. Concurrently, tuber and adaptation-related traits were selected under Michigan field conditions prior to self-compatibility assessment. After six cycles of RS, we observed a significant increase in self-compatibility (16\% in cycle 0–86\% in cycle 5) inheritance and improvement of tuber-related traits. Reproductive fitness was increased, reducing male sterility from 32\% in cycle 0 to 0\% in cycle 5. Progeny with no-flowers decreased from 19 to 3\% from RS cycles 0 to cycle 5. Additionally, 4,885 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) markers were used to access the linkage disequilibrium (LD), heterozygosity, and population structure over the RS population. SNP heterozygosity moderately decreased through the six cycles of RS cycles. Hierarchical clustering and Principal Components Analysis showed that selections become more uniform as the cycles advanced and that LD had been reduced across each potato chromosome. We observed significant increase in earliness for vine maturity in cycle 4. The SC germplasm developed in this study can be used to introgress self-compatibility, select tuber-related traits, and develop inbred lines in F1 hybrid programs using a genetically diverse diploid germplasm.},

As a result of the multiple chromosome sets in their genomes, higher orders of allele interactions can occur, implying different degrees of dominance.

In this study, we investigated the role of additive and dominance effects in the prediction of genotypic values for complex traits in autotetraploid species in the context of genomic selection. As autotetraploid model species, we used data from breeding populations of blueberry (Vaccinium spp., n = 1804) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L., n = 560), assessing genetic parameters and prediction ability of five and two horticultural traits, respectively. Using a Bayesian framework, the genotypic effects were estimated based on (i) realized additive and digenic dominance relationship matrices, and (ii) all markers included as explanatory variables under ridge regression and Bayes B approaches. When included, dominance effects explained part of the estimated genetic variance and resulted in better goodness-of-fit values. However, their predictive ability was similar to the predictability obtained with additive models. Although we have considered only autotetraploid species in this study, many of the ideas and results should be of more general interest, with applications in species with higher ploidy level.},

DNA sequences in one group contain the 533 bp insertion upstream of the start codon identified previously in self-compatible potato. The second group lacks the insertion. Three diploid and four polyploid individuals of wild species collected from geographically disjointed localities contained Sli with the 533 bp insertion. For most of the wild species clones examined, however, Sli did not have the insertion. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Sli sequences with the insertion, in wild species and in cultivated clones, trace back to a single origin. Some diploid wild potatoes that have Sli with the insertion were self-incompatible and some wild potatoes that lack the insertion were self-compatible. Although there is evidence of positive selection for some codon positions in Sli, there is no evidence of diversifying selection at the gene level. In silico analysis of Sli protein structure did not support the hypothesis that amino acid changes from wild-type (no insertion) to insertion-type account for changes in protein function. Our study demonstrated that genetic factors besides the Sli gene must be important for conditioning a switch in the mating system from self-incompatible to self-compatible in wild potatoes.},

  abstract = {Considerable differences occurred between selectors in intensity of selection when selecting the same potato clones in S, C1 and C2 (seedling, first clonal and second clonal years). Comparing clones selected or discarded in one year with clones selected or discarded in previous years indicated the effectiveness of selection and large differences were shown between different selector combinations. In some cases a highly significant improvement in the population was obtained; in others selection gave no improvement. A high proportion of the clones selected in C2 would always have been discarded in S or C1.},

  abstract = {It has been well established over a number of years that the apparent metabolisable energy (AME) value of wheat is highly variable. In 1983 and 1987 in Australia two surveys indicated that approximately 25\% of wheats have AME values lower than 13 MJ/kg.DM (range 10.4-15.9 MJ/kg.DM). Following recent studies it has been proposed that the soluble non-starch polysaccharide cell-wall components of wheat (mainly arabinoxylan with some G-glucan) have an anti-nitritive activity when wheats are present at high levels in broiler diets and are responsible for the low-AME wheat phenomenon. The main findings supporting this hypothesis are (1) wheat AME values are negatively correlated with soluble non-starch polysaccharide levels, (2) low level addition (30g/kg) of commercially available pur non-starch polysaccharides to broiler diets depresses the AME,of the diets, (3) degradation of the cell wall polysaccharides in situ by addition of glycanases to broiler diets raises AME values, and (4) addition of purified wheat arabinoxylan to broiler diets depresses the AME in a dose-dependant manner. The AME depression is a result of the inhibition of starch, lipid and proteindigestion in the fore-gut. This paper reviews the experiments and the data from the studies and discusses further aspects of the anti-nutritive activity of cereal polysaccharides in broiler diets. The possible role of the gut microflora in the growth depression observed when diets containing high levels of rye, barley and wheat are fed to broiler chickens is also examined.},

  abstract = {Although plants harbor a huge phytochemical diversity, only a fraction of plant metabolites is functionally characterized. In this work, we aimed to identify the genetic basis of metabolite functions during harsh environmental conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana. With machine learning algorithms we predicted stress-specific metabolomes for 23 (a)biotic stress phenotypes of 300 natural Arabidopsis accessions. The prediction models identified several aliphatic glucosinolates (GLSs) and their breakdown products to be implicated in responses to heat stress in siliques and herbivory by Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. Bivariate GWA mapping of the metabolome predictions and their respective (a)biotic stress phenotype revealed genetic associations with MAM, AOP, and GS-OH, all three involved in aliphatic GSL biosynthesis. We, therefore, investigated thrips herbivory on AOP, MAM, and GS-OH loss-of-function and/or overexpression lines. Arabidopsis accessions with a combination of MAM2 and AOP3, leading to 3-hydroxypropyl dominance, suffered less from thrips feeding damage. The requirement of MAM2 for this effect could, however, not be confirmed with an introgression line of ecotypes Cvi and Ler, most likely due to other, unknown susceptibility factors in the Ler background. However, AOP2 and GS-OH, adding alkenyl or hydroxy-butenyl groups, respectively, did not have major effects on thrips feeding. Overall, this study illustrates the complex implications of aliphatic GSL diversity in plant responses to heat stress and a cell-content-feeding herbivore.},

When these data are combined with full pedigree information back to founding parents, computing limitations mean it is not possible to obtain information on all parents. Family data from one sugarcane selection program were analysed using two different genetic models to investigate how different depths of pedigree and amount of data affect the reliability of estimating breeding value of sugarcane parents. These were the parental and animal models. Additive variance components and breeding values estimated from different amounts of information were compared for both models. The accuracy of estimating additive variance components and breeding values improved as more pedigree information and historical data were included in analyses. However, adding years of data had a much larger effect on the estimation of variance components of the population, and breeding values of the parents. To accurately estimate breeding values of all sugarcane parents, a minimum of three generations of pedigree and 5 years of historical data were required, while more information (four generations of pedigree and 7 years of historical data) was required when identifying top parents to be selected for future cross pollination.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

These were the parental and animal models. Additive variance components and breeding values estimated from different amounts of information were compared for both models. The accuracy of estimating additive variance components and breeding values improved as more pedigree information and historical data were included in analyses. However, adding years of data had a much larger effect on the estimation of variance components of the population, and breeding values of the parents. To accurately estimate breeding values of all sugarcane parents, a minimum of three generations of pedigree and 5 years of historical data were required, while more information (four generations of pedigree and 7 years of historical data) was required when identifying top parents to be selected for future cross pollination.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Here we describe an experiment that uses partially inbred CC lines to evaluate the genetic properties and utility of this emerging resource. Genome-wide analysis of the incipient strains reveals high genetic diversity, balanced allele frequencies, and dense, evenly distributed recombination sites-all ideal qualities for a systems genetics resource.

Analysis based on inferred haplotypes improves power, reduces false discovery, and provides information to identify and prioritize candidate genes that is unique to multifounder crosses like the CC.

We have developed 4 multi-parent populations: indica MAGIC (8 indica parents); MAGIC plus (8 indica parents with two additional rounds of 8-way F1 inter-crossing); japonica MAGIC (8 japonica parents); and Global MAGIC (16 parents – 8 indica and 8 japonica). The parents used in creating these populations are improved varieties with desirable traits for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, yield, and grain quality.

The indica MAGIC population is the most advanced of the MAGIC populations developed thus far and comprises 1328 lines produced by single seed descent (SSD). At the S4 stage of SSD a subset (200 lines) of this population was genotyped using a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach and was phenotyped for multiple traits, including: blast and bacterial blight resistance, salinity and submergence tolerance, and grain quality. Genome-wide association mapping identified several known major genes and QTLs including Sub1 associated with submergence tolerance and Xa4 and xa5 associated with resistance to bacterial blight. Moreover, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) results also identified potentially novel loci associated with essential traits for rice improvement. The MAGIC populations serve a dual purpose: permanent mapping populations for precise QTL mapping and for direct and indirect use in variety development.

  abstract = {The manner in which microorganisms utilize their metabolic processes can be predicted using constraint-based analysis of genome-scale metabolic networks. Herein, we present the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis toolbox, a software package running in the Matlab environment, which allows for quantitative prediction of cellular behavior using a constraint-based approach. Specifically, this software allows predictive computations of both steady-state and dynamic optimal growth behavior, the effects of gene deletions, comprehensive robustness analyses, sampling the range of possible cellular metabolic states and the determination of network modules. Functions enabling these calculations are included in the toolbox, allowing a user to input a genome-scale metabolic model distributed in Systems Biology Markup Language format and perform these calculations with just a few lines of code. The results are predictions of cellular behavior that have been verified as accurate in a growing body of research. After software installation, calculation time is minimal, allowing the user to focus on the interpretation of the computational results. INTRODUCTION Systems biology is a rapidly growing field 1 that is based on building and validating in silico models of biological systems using a wealth of experimental data. These models can be applied to generate novel, testable and often quantitative predictions of cellular beha-vior. Genome-scale network reconstruction efforts have been employed to generate models of diverse cellular processes such as signal transduction 2 , transcriptional regulation 3,4 and metabolism 5 . A reconstruction is herein defined as the list of biochemical reactions occurring in a particular cellular system (such as meta-bolism) and the associations between these reactions and relevant proteins, transcripts and genes. A reconstruction can be converted to a model by including the assumptions necessary for computa-tional simulation, for example, maximum reaction rates and nutrient uptake rates. An extensive array of methods for analyzing these kinds of genome-scale models have been developed and the methods have been applied to study a growing number of biological questions 6–10 . The constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) strategy is depicted in Figure 1. As reconstructed networks have been made publicly available by our group (http://systemsbiology.ucsd.edu/organisms) and other groups 11–14 , researchers around the world have undertaken novel computational studies utilizing the networks (see e.g., http:// systemsbiology.ucsd.edu/organisms/ecoli/ecoli\_others.html). Many studies apply a core set of basic in silico methods and often also describe novel methods to interrogate dif-ferent models. Despite the large number of studies utilizing reconstructed models, there is no single freely available software toolbox that would allow easy application of all these methods. This protocol aims to make in silico analysis of these networks accessible to researchers with a wide range of interests, particularly those who do not have expertise in the specific types of com-putations presented here. We have produced an integrated set of software tools that allows application of in silico methods that are commonly used to analyze reconstructed meta-bolic networks. Although we will only discuss the application of in silico methods to genome-scale metabolic networks, the majority of the methods described here can also be applied to study network properties of signaling network reconstructions 2 . Furthermore, in principle, constraint-based methods are applicable to any system that can be represented as a set of chemical reactions. The methods we describe inherently have limitations, as is true of all computational predictions, and the results of a simulation are best understood as hypotheses. For example, given the enormous quantity of double gene deletions possible in yeast, a model can in a short time frame predict which would reduce growth by between 50\% and 90\%, but the hypotheses about epistatic interactions between genes must be experimentally verified. However, consider-ing the low frequency of epistatic interactions discovered experi-mentally 15 , the model-based approach provides a valuable and reasonably sized starting set of hypothetical interactions for experi-mental testing.

In Europe, where wheat is the main staple, bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) covers the majority of land on which wheat is cropped. Wheat breeders and technologists have contributed greatly to the continued success of bread wheat and its products. The `bread-making quality' of a wheat variety can be described in relation to the processing its kernels must undergo to make a good bread. Bread wheat kernels must be suitable for proper milling into a flour that can produce a dough capable of becoming fine bread. The type of bread varies depending on local bread-making practices. Part I of this book contains a study of the anatomy and chemical composition of wheat kernels, and of the fundamental difference between `soft' and `hard' kernelled varieties. It relates these characteristics to the processes of milling, dough-making and manufacturing of bread, and to biscuit and pasta making. The genetic basis for these characteristics is illustrated, and assay methods for characterizing wheat varieties - ranging from Saunders' chewing test to the most recent developments in glutenin and gliadin research - are evaluated. Part II briefly describes - country by country - how bread-making quality has been integrated into wheat-breeding programmes throughout Europe, and how breeders have attempted to resolve the conflict between yield and quality. It describes how quality wheats `travelled' around the world - from their endogenic source in Eastern Europe to North America, and back again to Europe. This explains how specific genetic material can appear in the pedigrees of varieties grown in a wide range of agro-ecological zones. In addition to giving an interesting historical survey, the book points the way forward for breeders' efforts in the future.

  abstract = {Adaptation in response to selection on polygenic phenotypes may occur via subtle allele frequencies shifts at many loci. Current population genomic techniques are not well posed to identify such signals. In the past decade, detailed knowledge about the specific loci underlying polygenic traits has begun to emerge from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we combine this knowledge from GWAS with robust population genetic modeling to identify traits that may have been influenced by local adaptation. We exploit the fact that GWAS provide an estimate of the additive effect size of many loci to estimate the mean additive genetic value for a given phenotype across many populations as simple weighted sums of allele frequencies. We use a general model of neutral genetic value drift for an arbitrary number of populations with an arbitrary relatedness structure.

  abstract = {Adaptation in response to selection on polygenic phenotypes may occur via subtle allele frequencies shifts at many loci. Current population genomic techniques are not well posed to identify such signals. In the past decade, detailed knowledge about the specific loci underlying polygenic traits has begun to emerge from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we combine this knowledge from GWAS with robust population genetic modeling to identify traits that may have been influenced by local adaptation. We exploit the fact that GWAS provide an estimate of the additive effect size of many loci to estimate the mean additive genetic value for a given phenotype across many populations as simple weighted sums of allele frequencies. We use a general model of neutral genetic value drift for an arbitrary number of populations with an arbitrary relatedness structure. Based on this model, we develop methods for detecting unusually strong correlations between genetic values and specific environmental variables, as well as a generalization of (Formula presented.) comparisons to test for over-dispersion of genetic values among populations. Finally we lay out a framework to identify the individual populations or groups of populations that contribute to the signal of overdispersion.

My objective in this study was to determine, by simulation, the usefulness of genomewide selection for the rapid improvement of an adapted × exotic cross.

Responses increased as heritability increased and as the number of testcrosses that were phenotyped in Cycle 0 increased from 144 to 288. Overall, the results indicated that a useful strategy for the rapid improvement of an adapted × exotic cross involves 7 to 8 cycles of genomewide selection starting in the F2 rather than in a backcross population, even when the number of favorable alleles is substantially larger in the adapted parent than in the exotic parent. Assuming three generations can be grown per year in a greenhouse or year-round nursery, this procedure would require only 3 yr beyond the time required to develop and phenotype the Cycle 0 testcrosses.},

Abstract: A bandwagon is an idea, activity, or cause that becomes increasingly fashionable as more and more people adopt it. In a 1991 article entitled Bandwagons I Have Known, Professor N. W. Simmonds described several bandwagons that he encountered in his career, beginning with induced polyploidy and mutation breeding and ending with the then-new field of biotechnology.

The life cycle of a bandwagon includes an excitement phase of hype and funding; a realization phase when the initial hype is either tempered or the initial expectations are found to have been too low; and a reality phase when the useful aspects of a bandwagon become part of mainstream thinking and practice, or when an unsuccessful bandwagon is largely abandoned. During the realization phase, a new bandwagon that draws our attention and gives us renewed optimism typically arises. The most popular bandwagons, such as QTL mapping, are those for which the needed experimental resources are accessible, the required technical knowledge and skills can be easily learned, and the outputs can almost always be reported. The favorite bandwagon of any plant breeder has, in one way or another, resulted from Mendel’s seminal discoveries 150 years ago.

  abstract = {Estimation of genetic diversity and distance among tropical maize (Zea mays L.) lines and the correlation between genetic distance (GD) and hybrid performance would determine breeding strategies, classify inbred lines, define heterotic groups, and predict future hybrid performance. The objectives of this study were to estimate (i) heterosis and specific combining ability (SCA) for grain yield under stress and non-stress environments; (ii) genetic diversity for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) within a set of tropical lines; (iii) GD and classify the lines according to their GD; and (iv) correlation between the GD and hybrid performance, heterosis, and SCA. Seventeen lowland, white tropical inbred lines were represented in a diallel study. Inbred lines and hybrids were evaluated in 12 stress and non-stress environments. The expression of heterosis was greater under drought stress and smaller under low N environments than under nonstress environments. A set of DNA markers identifying 81 loci was used to fingerprint the 17 lines. The level of genetic diversity was high, with 4.65 alleles/locus and polymorphism information content (PIC) values ranging from 0.11 to 0.82. Genomic regions with quantitative trait loci (QTL) for drought tolerance previously identified showed lower genetic diversity. Genetic distance based on RFLP marker data classified the inbred lines in accordance with their pedigree. Positive correlation was found between GD and F1 performance (F1), SCA, midparent heterosis (MPH) and high-parent heterosis (HPH). Specific combining ability had the strongest correlation with GD. Environment significantly affected the correlations between F1, SCA, MPH, and HPH, with lower values of GD revealed in the more stressed conditions.}

  abstract = {Metritis is a uterine disease that affects 10 to 30\% of all lactating dairy cows and has detrimental effects on reproductive performance, milk production, and survival. Data regarding the identity and abundance of bacterial genes governing traits such as virulence, antibiotic resistance, and stress responses could enable identification of previously unknown agents that play a role in metritis pathogenesis. Moreover, such knowledge could lead to the development of improved treatments or preventive methods. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to characterize the uterine microbial population and to differentiate, for the first time, the microbial functional diversity in cows with metritis versus healthy cows. In addition, we aimed to identify relationships between microbial genes and postpartum uterine health. Uterine swabs were collected from 24 cows within 3 to 12 d in milk; 12 cows were diagnosed with metritis and the other 12 were healthy. Metritis was defined as a watery, reddish or brownish uterine discharge having a fetid smell, and rectal temperature greater than 39.5°C. Cows with a clear and viscous uterine discharge, not fetid or mucopurulent, were classified as healthy. Microbial metagenomic DNA from uterine swab samples was subjected to whole-genome shotgun sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). The MG-RAST server (metagenomic rapid annotations using subsystems technology; http://metagenomics.anl.gov/) and STAMP software (http://kiwi.cs.dal.ca/Software/STAMP) were used to detect statistically significant differences in the abundance of taxonomic and functional features between the uterine microbial metagenomes of metritic and healthy cows. Our results showed an increased abundance of Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes in metritic cows, confirming the potential role of those 2 taxa in the pathogenesis of metritis. The MG-RAST analysis revealed a significantly higher abundance of genes for protein transport across the cytoplasmic membrane and type VI bacterial secretion systems in the metritic microbiota. Additionally, genes coding for resistance to acid stress were exclusive to the metritis microbiota, suggesting that microbial resistance to acid stress is important for microbial survival in the infected uterus. On the other hand, genes coding for adhesion molecules, bacteriocins, and antibacterial peptides were significantly associated with the uterine microbiota of healthy cows, as was tolerance to colicin E2.},

  abstract = {Key message Proof of concept of Bayesian integrated QTL analyses across pedigree-related families from breeding programs of an outbreeding species. Results include QTL confidence intervals, individuals’ genotype probabilities and genomic breeding values. Abstract Bayesian QTL linkage mapping approaches offer the flexibility to study multiple full sib families with known pedigrees simultaneously. Such a joint analysis increases the probability of detecting these quantitative trait loci (QTL) and provide insight of the magnitude of QTL across different genetic backgrounds. Here, we present an improved Bayesian multi-QTL pedigree-based approach on an outcrossing species using progenies with different (complex) genetic relationships. Different modeling assumptions were studied in the QTL analyses, i.e., the a priori expected number of QTL varied and polygenic effects were considered. The inferences include number of QTL, additive QTL effect sizes and supporting credible intervals, posterior probabilities of QTL genotypes for all individuals in the dataset, and QTL-based as well as genome-wide breeding values. All these features have been implemented in the FlexQTL™ software. We analyzed fruit firmness in a large apple dataset that comprised 1,347 individuals forming 27 full sib families and their known ancestral pedigrees, with genotypes for 87 SSR markers on 17 chromosomes. We report strong or positive evidence for 14 QTL for fruit firmness on eight chromosomes, validating our approach as several of these QTL were reported previously, though dispersed over a series of studies based on single mapping populations. Interpretation of linked QTL was possible via individuals’ QTL genotypes. The correlation between the genomic breeding values and phenotypes was on average 90 \%, but varied with the number of detected QTL in a family. The detailed posterior knowledge on QTL of potential parents is critical for the efficiency of marker-assisted breeding.},

  abstract = {Key message Proof of concept of Bayesian integrated QTL analyses across pedigree-related families from breeding programs of an outbreeding species. Results include QTL confidence intervals, individuals’ genotype probabilities and genomic breeding values. Abstract Bayesian QTL linkage mapping approaches offer the flexibility to study multiple full sib families with known pedigrees simultaneously. Such a joint analysis increases the probability of detecting these quantitative trait loci (QTL) and provide insight of the magnitude of QTL across different genetic backgrounds. Here, we present an improved Bayesian multi-QTL pedigree-based approach on an outcrossing species using progenies with different (complex) genetic relationships. Different modeling assumptions were studied in the QTL analyses, i.e., the a priori expected number of QTL varied and polygenic effects were considered. The inferences include number of QTL, additive QTL effect sizes and supporting credible intervals, posterior probabilities of QTL genotypes for all individuals in the dataset, and QTL-based as well as genome-wide breeding values. All these features have been implemented in the FlexQTL™ software. We analyzed fruit firmness in a large apple dataset that comprised 1,347 individuals forming 27 full sib families and their known ancestral pedigrees, with genotypes for 87 SSR markers on 17 chromosomes. We report strong or positive evidence for 14 QTL for fruit firmness on eight chromosomes, validating our approach as several of these QTL were reported previously, though dispersed over a series of studies based on single mapping populations. Interpretation of linked QTL was possible via individuals’ QTL genotypes. The correlation between the genomic breeding values and phenotypes was on average 90 \%, but varied with the number of detected QTL in a family. The detailed posterior knowledge on QTL of potential parents is critical for the efficiency of marker-assisted breeding.},

  abstract = {Heterosis refers to the phenomenon that progeny of diverse varieties of a species or crosses between species exhibit greater biomass, speed of development, and fertility than both parents. Various models have been posited to explain heterosis, including dominance, overdominance, and pseudo-overdominance. In this Perspective, we consider that it might be useful to the field to abandon these terms that by their nature constrain data interpretation and instead attempt a progression to a quantitative genetic framework involving interactions in hierarchical networks. While we do not provide a comprehensive model to explain the phenomenology of heterosis, we provide the details of what needs to be explained and a direction of pursuit that we feel should be fruitful.},

  abstract = {To develop inbred lines from self-incompatible, cultivated diploid potatoes, an S-locus inhibitor (Sli) gene derived from a self-compatible variant of a wild potato species, Solanum chacoense, was incorporated into various cultivated diploid potatoes. The progeny was selfed twice by the action of the Sli gene to obtain 74 S 2 inbred clones belonging to 8 families. More than 40\% of them were either non-flowering or pollen sterile. Among the pollen fertile clones, self-compatible clones occurred with a much lower frequency (20.9\%) than expected (83.3\%). The result demonstrated that self-compatibility was introduced and expressed in the gene pool of cultivated diploid potatoes by an action of the Sli gene, although serious inbreeding depression associated with selfing occurred. The genotypes of S 2 inbreds were surveyed using 46 S. chacoense-specific RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) markers covering the whole potato genome. More than half of the markers (67.4\%) showed distorted segregation. Particularly, all markers on chromosome 12 were overrepresented in the S 2 inbreds. This confirms our earlier finding that the Sli gene locates on chromosome 12 and the alleles linked with this gene are preferentially transmitted because of its essential requirement for selfing. Résumé : Afin de développer des lignées fixées à partir de variétés diploïdes autoincompatibles de la pomme de terre, un gène inhibiteur du locus S (Sli) provenant d'un variant autocompatible d'une espèces sauvage de pomme de terre, Solanum chacoense, a été incorporé chez divers cultivars diploïdes de pomme de terre.

  abstract = {Breeding efforts for the potato sector are faced with the classical questions “What to breed?” and “How to breed?”. The answers to these questions are very diverse and challenged. Until recently these two questions were unrelated. With the increase in scientific knowledge and the public debate on modern tools, these questions have become intertwined. The “What to breed?” question has changed: breeders nowadays have to breed for wider adaptation to increasingly stressful environments with an increase in focus on quality demands by an increasingly complex and diverse food processing industry and distribution networks. The “How to breed?” question has changed also: public funding is increasingly scarce for agricultural research in general and for research on the biotechnology, molecular genetics and molecular biology of potato in particular. Young scientists also move away from the potato crop. However, the complexity of the inheritance and of the physiology of potato combined with the diverse stress to which this crop is exposed, requires large investments to be able to use modern scientific tools. Such huge investments are mostly too costly for the traditional dominant players in potato breeding despite the mergers that have taken place. The only solution for this is to link up with and stimulate international networks and use the modern information technology to obtain access to valuable scientific information. The technology used also determines public acceptance of the product, thus making the “What to breed?” and “How to breed?” questions interwoven. Another important issue that has affected the environment for potato breeders is the fact that breeders have not been defending their rights very well. Counterfeited multiplication of protected varieties has become commercially more important whereas new conventions and treaties have made the exchange and use of germplasm much more complicated. Modern potato breeders, while maintaining their classical skills, have to be prepared to be more involved in basic science, more receptive to public concerns and more proactive to protect their rights.},

The estimator that we consider is strongly inspired by the one proposed by Pirinen, Donnelly and Spencer (2013), and is based on a maximum likelihood approach. We also study the theoretical properties of our estimator, namely we establish that our estimator of the heritability is √n-consistent when both the number of observations n and the number of random effects N tend to infinity under mild assumptions. We also prove that our estimator of the heritability satisfies a central limit theorem which gives as a byproduct a confidence interval for the heritability. Some Monte-Carlo experiments are also conducted in order to show the finite sample performances of our estimator.},

We also study the theoretical properties of our estimator, namely we establish that our estimator of the heritability is √n-consistent when both the number of observations n and the number of random effects N tend to infinity under mild assumptions. We also prove that our estimator of the heritability satisfies a central limit theorem which gives as a byproduct a confidence interval for the heritability. Some Monte-Carlo experiments are also conducted in order to show the finite sample performances of our estimator.},

One of the principal challenges faced by polyploid organisms is to evolve stable meiotic mechanisms to faithfully transmit genetic information to the next generation upon which the study of inheritance is based. In this review we look at the tools available to the research community to better understand polyploid inheritance, many of which have only recently been developed. Most of these tools are intended for experimental populations (rather than natural populations), facilitating genomics-assisted crop improvement and plant breeding. This is hardly surprising given that a large proportion of domesticated plant species are polyploid.

We also briefly review some miscellaneous topics such as the mode of inheritance and the availability of polyploid simulation software. The current polyploid analytic toolbox includes software for assigning marker genotypes (and in particular, estimating the dosage of marker alleles in the heterozygous condition), establishing chromosome-scale linkage phase among marker alleles, constructing (short-range) haplotypes, generating linkage maps, performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses, and simulating polyploid populations. These tools can also help elucidate the mode of inheritance (disomic, polysomic or a mixture of both as in segmental allopolyploids) or reveal whether double reduction and multivalent chromosomal pairing occur. An increasing number of polyploids (or associated diploids) are being sequenced, leading to publicly available reference genome assemblies. Much work remains in order to keep pace with developments in genomic technologies. However, such technologies also offer the promise of understanding polyploid genomes at a level which hitherto has remained elusive.},

Mid-parent values, as well as progeny tests, are then used to select between the resultant crosses.

Finally, in seeking new cultivars, the number of clones on which to practise selection is increased by sowing more true seed of the best progenies, but without selection until the small-plot stage. Traits considered are resistance to late blight [Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary] and to the white potato cyst nematode [Globodera pallida (Stone)], fry colour and tuber yield and appearance, as visually assessed by breeders. The theoretical superiority of the strategy for seeking new cultivars lies in being able to practise between-cross selection for a number of economically important traits within 1 or 2 years of making crosses, something that is not possible on individuals as seedlings in the glasshouse or spaced plants at the seed site. This also means that full-sib family selection can be operated on a 3-year cycle, an improvement on current practice of clonal selection on what is often at least a nine-year cycle.

  abstract = {A number of improvements to conventional potato breeding are possible but they all have their limitations which need to be appreciated in designing new breeding programmes. Selection for quantitative traits between crosses before selection within the most promising ones can solve the problem of the inability of intense early-generation selection to affect most economically important traits. It also allows full-sib family selection to be practised but the rate of progress is limited by a low intensity of selection so that continued recurrent selection is required to accumulate small improvements into worthwhile ones.

  abstract = {A number of improvements to conventional potato breeding are possible but they all have their limitations which need to be appreciated in designing new breeding programmes. Selection for quantitative traits between crosses before selection within the most promising ones can solve the problem of the inability of intense early-generation selection to affect most economically important traits. It also allows full-sib family selection to be practised but the rate of progress is limited by a low intensity of selection so that continued recurrent selection is required to accumulate small improvements into worthwhile ones. The rate of progress from combined between and within cross selection is limited by the number of vegetative generations required to complete all necessary phenotypic assessments, as well as by the intensities of selection.

  abstract = {Increasing yield per hectare is an obvious breeding objective for potatoes, whether as a staple food for local consumption, as a vegetable for cash or as a crop for processing into food or starch. Selection is for high fresh-weight yield, at an appropriate dry-matter content for the end use, in assessment environments appropriate for the target length and nature of the growing season and agronomy inputs. As a quantitative trait, yield is assessed in field trials with due consideration of interference between plots and genotype × environment interactions. Combining ability analysis indicates adequate genetic variation for yield increases over generations that have proved difficult to achieve in practice (a conundrum). Consideration is therefore given to harvest index, tuberization in different day-lengths, ideotypes, eco-physiological models, path coefficient analysis, current gaps between actual and potential yields, tolerance of abiotic stresses such as drought, heat and salt, and nitrogen and phosphorous use efficiency.},

Potato breeders have therefore made planned artificial hybridizations to generate genetically unique seedlings and their clonal descendants from which to select new cultivars for tuber propagation.

This review looks at the history of how potato geneticists: 1) established that the principal cultivated potato is a tetraploid that displays tetrasomic inheritance (2n = 4x = 48); 2) developed progeny tests to determine the dosage of major genes for qualitative traits in potential parents, and also progeny tests for their general combining abilities for quantitative traits; and 3) provided molecular markers for the marker assisted selection of major genes and quantitative trait alleles of large effect, and for the genomic selection of many alleles of small effect.

Unfortunately, sprouting occurs above 4 degrees and impacts product quality, necessitating the use of sprout suppressant chemicals. Therefore, a goal of breeders is to develop potatoes with excellent fry color, which is maintained under storage below 8 degrees. Genomic or marker-assisted selection offers an opportunity to improve the efficiency of potato breeding and thereby assist breeders in achieving this goal. In this study, we have accumulated fry-color data on a large population of potato lines and combined this with genotypic data to carry out a GWAS and to evaluate accuracy of genomic prediction. We were able to identify a major QTL on chromosome 10 for fry color, and predict fry color with moderate accuracy using genome-wide markers. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that it is possible to identify a small subset of SNPs for processing characteristics that can give moderate predictive ability, albeit lower than that achieved with genome-wide markers.},

Therefore, a goal of breeders is to develop potatoes with excellent fry color, which is maintained under storage below 8 degrees. Genomic or marker-assisted selection offers an opportunity to improve the efficiency of potato breeding and thereby assist breeders in achieving this goal. In this study, we have accumulated fry-color data on a large population of potato lines and combined this with genotypic data to carry out a GWAS and to evaluate accuracy of genomic prediction. We were able to identify a major QTL on chromosome 10 for fry color, and predict fry color with moderate accuracy using genome-wide markers. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that it is possible to identify a small subset of SNPs for processing characteristics that can give moderate predictive ability, albeit lower than that achieved with genome-wide markers.},

  abstract = {Genomic selection uses total breeding values for juvenile animals, predicted from a large number of estimated marker haplotype effects across the whole genome. In this study the accuracy of predicting breeding values is compared for four different models including a large number of markers, at different marker densities for traits with heritabilities of 50 and 10\%. The models estimated the effect of (1) each single-marker allele ½single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)1, (2) haplotypes constructed from two adjacent marker alleles (SNP2), and (3) haplotypes constructed from 2 or 10 markers, including the covariance between haplotypes by combining linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis (HAP\_IBD2 and HAP\_IBD10). Between 119 and 2343 polymorphic SNPs were simulated on a 3-M genome. For the trait with a heritability of 10\%, the differences between models were small and none of them yielded the highest accuracies across all marker densities. For the trait with a heritability of 50\%, the HAP\_IBD10 model yielded the highest accuracies of estimated total breeding values for juvenile and phenotyped animals at all marker densities. It was concluded that genomic selection is considerably more accurate than traditional selection, especially for a low-heritability trait. T HE availability of many thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spread across the genome for different livestock species opens up possibilities to include genomewide marker information in prediction of total breeding values, to perform genomic selection. Compared to traditional breeding practice, including genomic information yields a considerable increase in selection responses for juvenile animals that do not have phenotypic records (Meuwissen et al. 2001) and potentially can reduce the costs of a breeding program up to 90\% (Schaeffer 2006). Genomic selection as described by Meuwissen et al. (2001) predicts total breeding values on the basis of a large number of marker haplotypes across the entire genome. The underlying assumption of genomic selection is that haplotypes at some loci are in linkage dis-equilibrium (LD) with QTL alleles that affect the traits that are subject to selection. Different ways of deriving haplotypes of combinations of marker alleles, and the relationship between haplotypes at a locus, have been described. One method (SNP1) is to consider each different marker allele at a single locus to be a different haplotype, considering no relationships between different haplotypes, and thus breeding values are estimated directly for the marker alleles (Xu 2003). A second method is to construct haplotypes from two alleles at adjacent markers, assuming a zero relation between haplotypes at the same locus (SNP2) (Meuwissen et al. 2001). A third method is to construct haplotypes (HAP\_IBD) using two or more surrounding marker alleles and derive identical-by-descent (IBD) probabilities between the different haplotypes at the same locus (Meuwissen and Goddard 2001). The SNP1 model considers only two haplotypes at a locus and therefore may be suited for applications in, for instance, double-haploid populations with only two segregating genotypes at each locus (Xu 2003). For outbred populations, where the association between markers and QTL might be different in different families , the SNP1 model is perhaps less well suited. The advantage of the SNP1 approach is that determining the linkage phase of the haplotypes is not required and the markers do not need to be mapped. A disadvantage of the SNP1 model is that no new haplotypes arise as a result of recombination, while such an event actually might change the linkage between the marker and the QTL alleles. SNP1 and SNP2 do not make a distinction between haplotypes that are alike-in-state (AIS) due to a common ancestor (i.e., IBD) or simply due to chance. The benefit from the HAP\_IBD approach is that the common background of haplotypes, and thus the probability that different haplotypes are associated with the 1},

Since neither higher grain yields nor harvest indices appear to be consistently associated with reduced straw digestibility, the potential exists for breeding or selecting varieties combining these characteristics. Shorter varieties of barley and wheat contain higher proportions of leaf blade in the straw than taller material. In rice, conversely, more leaf blade is found in taller varieties. In barley and wheat, leaf blade is more digestible in vitro than either leaf sheath and stem and thus, straw from shorter varieties is more digestible. In rice, leaf blade is less digestible than the stem fraction. Thus, in rice, as well as barley and wheat, shorter material is likely to result in higher feeding value. Stem diameter does not influence straw quality in barley. A greater number of days from planting to either flowering or grain maturity results in increased leaf-blade content in barley and rice straw. In barley, selection for early maturity is likely to lead to reduced straw digestibility but in rice, straw digestibility could be expected to improve. Feeding trials suggest that early maturity in barley results in lower straw voluntary intake. Proportions of leaf and stem appear to explain variations in cellulase solubility of straw from different barley genotypes more closely than levels of soluble phenolics, residual phenolics or titratable groups. However, levels of soluble phenolics or titratable groups were effective in differentiating between untreated straw and straw treated with sodium hydroxide. The effect of variation in straw morphology on the feasibility of chemical treatment to improve straw quality is discussed. In barley straw, leaf sheath responded more to sodium-hydroxide treatment than other straw fractions, suggesting that varieties with greater proportions of leaf blade and stem are likely to show poorer responses to treatment. Aqueous ammonia had only a small effect on the cellulase solubility of leaf blade, compared with sodium-hydroxide treatment.

Straw from varieties with a high leaf-blade content and good initial digestibility is likely to show a smaller improvement in digestibility upon treatment with aqueous ammonia compared with straw from varieties with lower initial value.},

  abstract = {Modern cereal varieties tend to have higher grain yields, improved harvest indices, be shorter and earlier maturing than their traditional counterparts. Since neither higher grain yields nor harvest indices appear to be consistently associated with reduced straw digestibility, the potential exists for breeding or selecting varieties combining these characteristics. Shorter varieties of barley and wheat contain higher proportions of leaf blade in the straw than taller material. In rice, conversely, more leaf blade is found in taller varieties. In barley and wheat, leaf blade is more digestible in vitro than either leaf sheath and stem and thus, straw from shorter varieties is more digestible. In rice, leaf blade is less digestible than the stem fraction. Thus, in rice, as well as barley and wheat, shorter material is likely to result in higher feeding value. Stem diameter does not influence straw quality in barley. A greater number of days from planting to either flowering or grain maturity results in increased leaf-blade content in barley and rice straw. In barley, selection for early maturity is likely to lead to reduced straw digestibility but in rice, straw digestibility could be expected to improve. Feeding trials suggest that early maturity in barley results in lower straw voluntary intake. Proportions of leaf and stem appear to explain variations in cellulase solubility of straw from different barley genotypes more closely than levels of soluble phenolics, residual phenolics or titratable groups. However, levels of soluble phenolics or titratable groups were effective in differentiating between untreated straw and straw treated with sodium hydroxide. The effect of variation in straw morphology on the feasibility of chemical treatment to improve straw quality is discussed. In barley straw, leaf sheath responded more to sodium-hydroxide treatment than other straw fractions, suggesting that varieties with greater proportions of leaf blade and stem are likely to show poorer responses to treatment. Aqueous ammonia had only a small effect on the cellulase solubility of leaf blade, compared with sodium-hydroxide treatment. Straw from varieties with a high leaf-blade content and good initial digestibility is likely to show a smaller improvement in digestibility upon treatment with aqueous ammonia compared with straw from varieties with lower initial value.},

By including all variants in the association model, the dimensionality of the problem should be dramatically increased, and it could undoubtedly reduce the statistical power. Using all Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to compute the genomic relationship matrix (G) does not necessarily increase accuracy as the additive relationships can be accurately estimated using a much smaller number of markers. Due to these limitations, variant prioritization has become a necessity to improve accuracy. The fixation index (FST) as a measure of population differentiation has been used to identify genome segments and variants under selection pressure. Using prioritized variants has increased the accuracy of GS. Additionally, FST can be used to weight the relative contribution of prioritized SNPs in computing G. In this study, relative weights based on FST scores were developed and incorporated into the calculation of G and their impact on the estimation of variance components and accuracy was assessed. The results showed that prioritizing SNPs based on their FST scores resulted in an increase in the genetic similarity between training and validation animals and improved the accuracy of GS by more than 5\%.},

Using all Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to compute the genomic relationship matrix (G) does not necessarily increase accuracy as the additive relationships can be accurately estimated using a much smaller number of markers. Due to these limitations, variant prioritization has become a necessity to improve accuracy. The fixation index (FST) as a measure of population differentiation has been used to identify genome segments and variants under selection pressure. Using prioritized variants has increased the accuracy of GS. Additionally, FST can be used to weight the relative contribution of prioritized SNPs in computing G. In this study, relative weights based on FST scores were developed and incorporated into the calculation of G and their impact on the estimation of variance components and accuracy was assessed. The results showed that prioritizing SNPs based on their FST scores resulted in an increase in the genetic similarity between training and validation animals and improved the accuracy of GS by more than 5\%.},

  abstract = {Background: Phenotypic records of group means or group sums are a good alternative to individual records for some difficult to measure, but economically important traits such as feed efficiency or egg production. Accuracy of predicted breeding values based on group records increases with increasing relationships between group members. The classical way to form groups with more closely-related animals is based on pedigree information. When genotyp-ing information is available before phenotyping, its use to form groups may further increase the accuracy of prediction from group records. This study analyzed two grouping methods based on genomic information: (1) unsupervised clustering implemented in the STRU CTU RE software and (2) supervised clustering that models genomic relationships. Results: Using genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) models, estimates of the genetic variance based on group records were consistent with those based on individual records. When genomic information was available to constitute the groups, genomic relationship coefficients between group members were higher than when random grouping of paternal half-sibs and of full-sibs was applied. Grouping methods that are based on genomic information resulted in higher accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) prediction compared to random grouping. The increase was \textbackslash textasciitilde 1.5\% for full-sibs and \textbackslash textasciitilde 11.5\% for paternal half-sibs. In addition, grouping methods that are based on genomic information led to lower coancestry coefficients between the top animals ranked by GEBV. Of the two proposed methods, supervised clustering was superior in terms of accuracy, computation requirements and applicability. By adding surplus genotyped offspring (more genotyped offspring than required to fill the groups), the advantage of supervised clustering increased by up to 4.5\% compared to random grouping of full-sibs, and by 14.7\% compared to random grouping of paternal half-sibs. This advantage also increased with increasing family sizes or decreasing genome sizes. Conclusions: The use of genotyping information for grouping animals increases the accuracy of selection when phenotypic group records are used in genomic selection breeding programs.},

  abstract = {Self-compatible (SC) diploid potatoes allow innovative potato breeding. Therefore, the Sli gene, originally described in S. chacoense, has received much attention. In elite S. tuberosum diploids, spontaneous berry set is occasionally observed. We aimed to map SC from S. tuberosum origin. Two full-sib mapping populations from non-inbred diploids were used. Bulks were composed based on both pollen tube growth and berry set upon selfing. After DNA sequencing of the parents and bulks, we generated k-mer tables. Set algebra and depth filtering were used to identify bulk-specific k-mers. Coupling and repulsion phase k-mers, transmitted from the SC parent, mapped in both populations to the distal end of chromosome 12. Intersection between the k-mers from both populations, in coupling phase with SC, exposed a shared haplotype of approximately 1.5 Mb. Subsequently, we screened read archives of potatoes and wild relatives for k-mers specific to this haplotype. The well-known SC clones US-W4 and RH89-039-16, but surprisingly, also S. chacoense clone M6 were positives. Hence, the S. tuberosum source of SC seems identical to Sli. Furthermore, the candidate region drastically reduced to 333 kb. Haplotype-specific KASP markers were designed and validated on a panel of diploid clones including another renown SC dihaploid G254. Interestingly, k-mers specific to the SC haplotype were common in tetraploid varieties. Pedigree information suggests that the SC haplotype was introduced into tetraploid varieties via the founder “Rough Purple Chili”. We show that Sli is surprisingly widespread and indigenous to the cultivated gene pool of potato.},

  abstract = {Semidwarf maize (Zea mays L.) could be grown in new areas of production or in alternative crop rotations. Our objectives were to determine (i) if genomewide selection is useful for the rapid improvement of an exotic × adapted cross, (ii) if genomewide selection is more effective than phenotypic backcrossing for a trait with major genes, and (iii) the extent to which the high grain yield of nondwarf maize can be combined with the reduced stature and adaptability to high plant population densities of semidwarf maize. We conducted four cycles of genomewide selection in two semidwarf × adapted crosses. Phenotypic backcrossing was also done until the BC4 with selection for short plants. The accuracy of genomewide predictions in Cycle 0 was 0.67 to 0.70 for plant height and 0.57 to 0.70 for grain yield. Genomewide selection from Cycle 1 until Cycle 5 either maintained or improved on the gains from phenotypic selection achieved in Cycle 1. Observed gains generally agreed with predicted gains.

  abstract = {Semidwarf maize (Zea mays L.) could be grown in new areas of production or in alternative crop rotations. Our objectives were to determine (i) if genomewide selection is useful for the rapid improvement of an exotic × adapted cross, (ii) if genomewide selection is more effective than phenotypic backcrossing for a trait with major genes, and (iii) the extent to which the high grain yield of nondwarf maize can be combined with the reduced stature and adaptability to high plant population densities of semidwarf maize. We conducted four cycles of genomewide selection in two semidwarf × adapted crosses. Phenotypic backcrossing was also done until the BC4 with selection for short plants. The accuracy of genomewide predictions in Cycle 0 was 0.67 to 0.70 for plant height and 0.57 to 0.70 for grain yield. Genomewide selection from Cycle 1 until Cycle 5 either maintained or improved on the gains from phenotypic selection achieved in Cycle 1. Observed gains generally agreed with predicted gains. Cycle 5 did not always have the best mean performance. Unfavorable genetic correlations made it difficult to select for short plants with high grain yield. Linkage disequilibrium between markers declined as selection progressed. Compared with phenotypic backcrossing, genomewide selection led to better mean performance and a higher proportion of exotic germplasm introgressed.

  abstract = {Hybrid vigour has the potential to substantially increase the yield of self-pollinating crops such as wheat and rice, but future hybrid performance may depend on the initial strategy to form heterotic pools. We used in silico stochastic simulation of future hybrid performance in a self-pollinating crop to evaluate three strategies of forming heterotic pools in the founder population. The model included either 500, 2000 or 8000 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) across 10 chromosomes that contributed to a quantitative trait with population mean 100 and variance 10. The average degree of dominance at each QTN was either 0.2, 0.4 or 0.8 with variance 0.2. Three strategies for splitting the founder population into two heterotic pools were compared: (i) random split; (ii) split based on genetic distance according to principal component analysis of SNP genotypes; and (iii) optimized split based on F1 hybrid performance in a diallel cross among the founders. Future hybrid performance was stochastically simulated over 30 cycles of reciprocal recurrent selection based on true genetic values for additive and dominance effects. The three strategies of forming heterotic pools produced similar future hybrid performance, and superior future hybrids to a control population selected on inbred line performance when the number of quantitative trait nucleotides was ≥2000 and/or the average degree of dominance was ≥0.4.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is a promising method for genomic-enabled prediction. However, the implementation of DL is difficult because many hyperparameters (number of hidden layers, number of neurons, learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, etc.) need to be tuned. For this reason, deep kernel methods, which only require defining the number of layers, may be an attractive alternative. Deep kernel methods emulate DL models with a large number of neurons, but are defined by relatively easily computed covariance matrices. In this research, we compared the genome-based prediction of DL to a deep kernel (arc-cosine kernel, AK), to the commonly used non-additive Gaussian kernel (GK), as well as to the conventional additive genomic best linear unbiased predictor (GBLUP/GB). We used two real wheat data sets for benchmarking these methods. On average, AK and GK outperformed DL and GB. The gain in terms of prediction performance of AK and GK over DL and GB was not large, but AK and GK have the advantage that only one parameter, the number of layers (AK) or the bandwidth parameter (GK), has to be tuned in each method. Furthermore, although AK and GK had similar performance, deep kernel AK is easier to implement than GK, since the parameter “number of layers” is more easily determined than the bandwidth parameter of GK. Comparing AK and DL for the data set of year 2015–2016, the difference in performance of the two methods was bigger, with AK predicting much better than DL. On this data, the optimization of the hyperparameters for DL was difficult and the finally used parameters may have been suboptimal. Our results suggest that AK is a good alternative to DL with the advantage that practically no tuning process is required.},

This research investigated the GP of four genome-based prediction models with genotype ×environment interactions (GE): (1) single trait reaction norm model ( M1 ), (2) single trait model considering covariances between environments ( M2 ), (3) single trait M2 extended to include a random vector that utilizes the environmental covariances ( M3 ) and (4) multi-trait model with GE ( M4 ). Several prediction problems were analyzed for each of the GP accuracy of the four models. Results of the prediction of traits in HEL, the high yield potential testing site in 2021, show that the best predicted traits were tuber flesh starch (\%), weight of tuber above 60 or below 40 mm in size, and total tuber weight. In terms of GP, accuracy model M4 gave the best prediction accuracy in three traits, namely tuber weight of 40–50 or above 60 mm in size, and total tuber weight and very similar in the starch trait.

It has also been hypothesized that an appropriate selection of a subset of haplotype blocks can result in similar or better predictive ability than when using the whole set of haplotype blocks. This study investigated genomic prediction using a set of haplotype blocks that contained the SNPs with large effects estimated from an individual SNP prediction model. We analyzed protein yield, fertility and mastitis of Nordic Holstein cattle, and used high-density markers (about 770k SNPs). To reach an optimum number of haplotype variables for genomic prediction, predictions were performed using subsets of haplotype blocks that contained a range of 1000 to 50 000 main SNPs. RESULTS The use of haplotype blocks improved the prediction reliabilities, even when selection focused on only a group of haplotype blocks. In this case, the use of haplotype blocks that contained the 20 000 to 50 000 SNPs with the highest effect was sufficient to outperform the model that used all individual SNPs as predictors (up to 1.3 \% improvement in prediction reliability for mastitis, compared to individual SNP approach), and the achieved reliabilities were similar to those using all haplotype blocks available in the genome data (from 0.6 \% lower to 0.8 \% higher reliability). CONCLUSIONS Haplotype blocks used as predictors can improve the reliability of genomic prediction compared to the individual SNP model. Furthermore, the use of a subset of haplotype blocks that contains the main SNP effects from genomic data could be a feasible approach to genomic prediction in dairy cattle, given an increase in density of genotype data available. The predictive ability of the models that use a subset of haplotype blocks was similar to that obtained using either all haplotype blocks or all individual SNPs, with the benefit of having a much lower computational demand.},

In this case, the use of haplotype blocks that contained the 20 000 to 50 000 SNPs with the highest effect was sufficient to outperform the model that used all individual SNPs as predictors (up to 1.3 \% improvement in prediction reliability for mastitis, compared to individual SNP approach), and the achieved reliabilities were similar to those using all haplotype blocks available in the genome data (from 0.6 \% lower to 0.8 \% higher reliability). CONCLUSIONS Haplotype blocks used as predictors can improve the reliability of genomic prediction compared to the individual SNP model. Furthermore, the use of a subset of haplotype blocks that contains the main SNP effects from genomic data could be a feasible approach to genomic prediction in dairy cattle, given an increase in density of genotype data available. The predictive ability of the models that use a subset of haplotype blocks was similar to that obtained using either all haplotype blocks or all individual SNPs, with the benefit of having a much lower computational demand.},

  abstract = {The amount of functional genomic information has been growing rapidly but remains largely unused in genomic selection. Genomic prediction and estimation using haplotypes in genome regions with functional elements such as all genes of the genome can be an approach to integrate functional and structural genomic information for genomic selection. Towards this goal, this article develops a new haplotype approach for genomic prediction and estimation. A multi-allelic haplotype model treating each haplotype as an ‘allele’ was developed for genomic prediction and estimation based on the partition of a multi-allelic genotypic value into additive and dominance values. Each additive value is expressed as a function of h − 1 additive effects, where h = number of alleles or haplotypes, and each dominance value is expressed as a function of h(h − 1)/2 dominance effects. For a sample of q individuals, the limit number of effects is 2q − 1 for additive effects and is the number of heterozygous genotypes for dominance effects. Additive values are factorized as a product between the additive model matrix and the h − 1 additive effects, and dominance values are factorized as a product between the dominance model matrix and the h(h − 1)/2 dominance effects. Genomic additive relationship matrix is defined as a function of the haplotype model matrix for additive effects, and genomic dominance relationship matrix is defined as a function of the haplotype model matrix for dominance effects. Based on these results, a mixed model implementation for genomic prediction and variance component estimation that jointly use haplotypes and single markers is established, including two computing strategies for genomic prediction and variance component estimation with identical results. The multi-allelic genetic partition fills a theoretical gap in genetic partition by providing general formulations for partitioning multi-allelic genotypic values and provides a haplotype method based on the quantitative genetics model towards the utilization of functional and structural genomic information for genomic prediction and estimation.},

While predicting risk has been successful in diseases which follow simple Mendelian inheritance, it has proven challenging in complex diseases for which a large number of loci contribute to the genetic variance. The large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms now available provide new opportunities for predicting genetic risk of complex diseases with high accuracy. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have derived simple deterministic formulae to predict the accuracy of predicted genetic risk from population or case control studies using a genome-wide approach and assuming a dichotomous disease phenotype with an underlying continuous liability. We show that the prediction equations are special cases of the more general problem of predicting the accuracy of estimates of genetic values of a continuous phenotype. Our predictive equations are responsive to all parameters that affect accuracy and they are independent of allele frequency and effect distributions. Deterministic prediction errors when tested by simulation were generally small. The common link among the expressions for accuracy is that they are best summarized as the product of the ratio of number of phenotypic records per number of risk loci and the observed heritability. Conclusions/Significance: This study advances the understanding of the relative power of case control and population studies of disease. The predictions represent an upper bound of accuracy which may be achievable with improved effect estimation methods. The formulae derived will help researchers determine an appropriate sample size to attain a certain accuracy when predicting genetic risk.},

  abstract = {This study evaluates the impact of genomic prediction models on selecting inbred lines as parents in hybrid breeding programs. New parents in a hybrid breeding program are typically selected from early-stage yield trials based on general combining ability (GCA) from testcrosses. Genomic studies have largely focused on predicting hybrid performance in the late stages of the breeding pipeline and largely ignored the selection of inbred lines as parents of the subsequent breeding cycles. Here, we used stochastic simulations of a maize (Zea mays L.) hybrid breeding program for 20 years to evaluate the performance of genomic prediction models for selecting parents based on their predicted GCA. Five genomic prediction models were evaluated in terms of achieved genetic gain and heterosis under two different single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker densities and the true quantitative trait loci genotypes. The results show that using high-density SNP markers generated more genetic gain and heterosis than the low-density SNP markers. The relative performance of genomic prediction models differed across marker scenarios. For genetic gain, we observed more differences between the models at low than high marker density. For heterosis, we observed the opposite, more differences between the models at high than low marker density. Overall, models that fitted the average or additive effects specific to each heterotic pool and dominance effects provide a better fit and hence higher genetic gain in hybrid breeding programs.},

Molecular markers allow describing the genome of individuals at a large number of loci, and this opens possibilities to derive accurate prediction of genetic values early in life. The first attempts to incorporate marker information into predictions were based on the presumption that one can localize causative mutations underlying genetic variation.

Several factors contributed to this: first, with a few exceptions, the proportion of the variance accounted by mapped QTL has commonly been small. Second, the financial resources required to develop the populations needed to map QTL were considerable, limiting the adoption of this technology (see Dekkers 2004, Bernardo 2008, Collard and Mackill 2008, and Hospital 2009 for insightful discussions of lessons learned from QTL studies in animal and plant breeding). There is a general consensus that most traits are affected by large numbers of small-effect genes (see Buckler et al. 2009, for examples of traits in maize affected by large numbers of small-effect loci) and that the prediction of complex traits requires considering large numbers of variants concurrently.

  abstract = {The introduction of alleles into commercial crop breeding pipelines is both time consuming and costly. Two technologies that are disrupting traditional breeding processes are doubled haploid (DH) breeding and genome editing (GE). Recently, these techniques were combined into a GE trait delivery system called HI-Edit (Haploid Inducer-Edit) [1]. In HI-Edit, the pollen of a haploid inducer line is reprogrammed to deliver GE traits to any variety, obviating recurrent selection. For HI-Edit to operate at scale, an efficient transformable HI line is needed, but most maize varieties are recalcitrant to transformation, and haploid inducers are especially difficult to transform given their aberrant reproductive behaviors. Leveraging marker assisted selection and a three-tiered testing scheme, we report the development of new Iodent and Stiff Stalk maize germplasm that are transformable, have high haploid induction rates, and exhibit a robust, genetically-dominant anthocyanin native trait that may be used for rapid haploid identification. We show that transformation of these elite “HI-Edit” lines is enhanced using the BABYBOOM and WUSCHEL morphogenetic factors. Finally, we evaluate the HI-Edit performance of one of the lines against both Stiff Stalk and non-Stiff Stalk testers. The strategy and results of this study should facilitate the development of commercially scalable HI-Edit systems in diverse crops.},

  abstract = {Genomic selection is an upgrading form of marker-assisted selection for quantitative traits, and it differs from the traditional marker-assisted selection in that markers in the entire genome are used to predict genetic values and the QTL detection step is skipped. Genomic selection holds the promise to be more efficient than the traditional marker-assisted selection for traits controlled by poly-genes. Genomic selection for pure breed improvement is based on marker information and thus leads to cost-saving due to early selection before phenotypes are measured. When applied to hybrid breeding, genomic selection is anticipated to be even more efficient because genotypes of hybrids are predetermined by their inbred parents. Hybrid breeding has been an important tool to increase crop productivity. Here we proposed and applied an advanced method to predict hybrid performance, in which a subset of all potential hybrids is used as a training sample to predict trait values of all potential hybrids. The method is called genomic best linear unbiased prediction. The technology applied to hybrids is called genomic hybrid breeding. We used 278 randomly selected hybrids derived from 210 recombinant inbred lines of rice as a training sample and predicted all 21,945 potential hybrids. The average yield of top 100 selection shows a 16\% increase compared with the average yield of all potential hybrids. The new strategy of marker-guided prediction of hybrid yields serves as a proof of concept for a new technology that may potentially revolutionize hybrid breeding. hybrid rice \textbackslash textbar IMF2 \textbackslash textbar mixed model \textbackslash textbar restricted maximum likelihood \textbackslash textbar variance component analysis T he mission of plant breeding is to develop high-yield varieties to increase crop productivity to meet the need of human population. Hybrid breeding has been proved to be an important tool to improve yield. The most successful examples are hybrid maize and rice, which have greatly increased the global food security. Despite the successes of hybrid breeding programs, selection of desirable hybrids has largely been a practice of trial and error in the past. It takes much luck to find desired matches between selected parents. The biggest challenge in hybrid breeding is how to predict the performance of future crosses based on existing data. Large efforts have been made in the past to develop methods for hybrid prediction, with the goal to facilitate hybrid breeding by obtaining better hybrids with fewer crosses. A common approach in the early days was to find correlations between marker polymorphisms and hybrid performance in crosses involving diverse germplasms. Extensive studies in corn and rice using this approach have produced variable results depending on the germplasms used in the studies (1). Bernardo (2) applied best linear unbiased prediction technology to predict hybrid corn. He used existing hybrids and the pedigree relationship between them and untested hybrids to make prediction. Recent development in genomic research has greatly increased the availability of molecular makers to easily cover the entire genome, which are used to calculate the relationship matrix, leading to a method called genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) (3). This method has been used to predict heterotic traits in maize hybrids (4). However, no attempt has been made to incorporate nonadditive effects into the prediction models. Genomic selection aims to use whole-genome markers to predict future individuals, and it differs from traditional predictions in that the marker-detection step is skipped; instead, all markers are used to predict genomic values. Theoretically, when the number of markers is larger than the sample size, there is no unique estimation of effects, but the total genomic value remains estimable. Therefore, genomic prediction does not require accurate estimates of effects; it concerns the predictability resulted from the combination of all markers and their collective effects. Such ge-nomic prediction has been applied to many agricultural species, including dairy cattle (5), crops (6), mice (7), and even humans (8).

  abstract = {Genomic selection is an upgrading form of marker-assisted selection for quantitative traits, and it differs from the traditional marker-assisted selection in that markers in the entire genome are used to predict genetic values and the QTL detection step is skipped. Genomic selection holds the promise to be more efficient than the traditional marker-assisted selection for traits controlled by poly-genes. Genomic selection for pure breed improvement is based on marker information and thus leads to cost-saving due to early selection before phenotypes are measured. When applied to hybrid breeding, genomic selection is anticipated to be even more efficient because genotypes of hybrids are predetermined by their inbred parents. Hybrid breeding has been an important tool to increase crop productivity. Here we proposed and applied an advanced method to predict hybrid performance, in which a subset of all potential hybrids is used as a training sample to predict trait values of all potential hybrids. The method is called genomic best linear unbiased prediction. The technology applied to hybrids is called genomic hybrid breeding. We used 278 randomly selected hybrids derived from 210 recombinant inbred lines of rice as a training sample and predicted all 21,945 potential hybrids. The average yield of top 100 selection shows a 16\% increase compared with the average yield of all potential hybrids. The new strategy of marker-guided prediction of hybrid yields serves as a proof of concept for a new technology that may potentially revolutionize hybrid breeding. hybrid rice | IMF2 | mixed model | restricted maximum likelihood | variance component analysis T he mission of plant breeding is to develop high-yield varieties to increase crop productivity to meet the need of human population. Hybrid breeding has been proved to be an important tool to improve yield. The most successful examples are hybrid maize and rice, which have greatly increased the global food security. Despite the successes of hybrid breeding programs, selection of desirable hybrids has largely been a practice of trial and error in the past. It takes much luck to find desired matches between selected parents. The biggest challenge in hybrid breeding is how to predict the performance of future crosses based on existing data. Large efforts have been made in the past to develop methods for hybrid prediction, with the goal to facilitate hybrid breeding by obtaining better hybrids with fewer crosses. A common approach in the early days was to find correlations between marker polymorphisms and hybrid performance in crosses involving diverse germplasms. Extensive studies in corn and rice using this approach have produced variable results depending on the germplasms used in the studies (1). Bernardo (2) applied best linear unbiased prediction technology to predict hybrid corn. He used existing hybrids and the pedigree relationship between them and untested hybrids to make prediction. Recent development in genomic research has greatly increased the availability of molecular makers to easily cover the entire genome, which are used to calculate the relationship matrix, leading to a method called genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) (3). This method has been used to predict heterotic traits in maize hybrids (4). However, no attempt has been made to incorporate nonadditive effects into the prediction models. Genomic selection aims to use whole-genome markers to predict future individuals, and it differs from traditional predictions in that the marker-detection step is skipped; instead, all markers are used to predict genomic values. Theoretically, when the number of markers is larger than the sample size, there is no unique estimation of effects, but the total genomic value remains estimable. Therefore, genomic prediction does not require accurate estimates of effects; it concerns the predictability resulted from the combination of all markers and their collective effects. Such ge-nomic prediction has been applied to many agricultural species, including dairy cattle (5), crops (6), mice (7), and even humans (8). However, this approach has not been used to predict hybrid performance, an unexplored area that has a great potential to significantly improve efficiency of hybrid breeding. Current methods for genomic prediction include Bayes B (9), empirical Bayes (10), least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) (11), and GBLUP (3).

  abstract = {Genomic prediction from whole-genome sequence data is attractive, as the accuracy of genomic prediction is no longer bounded by extent of linkage disequilibrium between DNA markers and causal mutations affecting the trait, given the causal mutations are in the data set. A cost-effective strategy could be to sequence a small proportion of the population, and impute sequence data to the rest of the reference population. Here, we describe strategies for selecting individuals for sequencing, based on either pedigree relationships or haplotype diversity. Performance of these strategies (number of variants detected and accuracy of imputation) were evaluated in sequence data simulated through a real Belgian Blue cattle pedigree. A strategy (AHAP), which selected a subset of individuals for sequencing that maximized the number of unique haplotypes (from single-nucleotide polymorphism panel data) sequenced gave good performance across a range of variant minor allele frequencies. We then investigated the optimum number of individuals to sequence by fold coverage given a maximum total sequencing effort. At 600 total fold coverage (x 600), the optimum strategy was to sequence 75 individuals at eightfold coverage. Finally, we investigated the accuracy of genomic predictions that could be achieved. The advantage of using imputed sequence data compared with dense SNP array genotypes was highly dependent on the allele frequency spectrum of the causative mutations affecting the trait. When this followed a neutral distribution, the advantage of the imputed sequence data was small; however, when the causal mutations all had low minor allele frequencies, using the sequence data improved the accuracy of genomic prediction by up to 30\%.},

  abstract = {Abstract Potato OFP20 is associated with the regulation of tuber shape. To further characterise the role of this gene in tuber shape, a panel of 136 potato varieties was re-sequenced to identify variants in the coding region of StOFP20. These SNPs were assembled into haplotypes and their allelic dosage was determined. Haplotype StOFP20.1 is the most common allele (65\%) which in quadruplex condition results in long tubers. StOFP20.3 represents the second most common haplotype (22\%) and is recognized as a dominant allele that is associated with round tubers in a dosage dependent manner. StOFP20.4 represents the third common haplotype (5\%) and encodes a non-functional gene. The remaining haplotypes represent rare alleles and their phenotypic effect is unclear. We developed reliable DNA markers that distinguish between the long and round alleles for marker-assisted selection of tuber shape in a diverse collection of varieties. We also demonstrate that we can genetically engineer the tuber shape of two commercial tetraploid varieties and the diploid clone DM. Knock down of StOFP20 in the variety Atlantic using the RNAi strategy changed the tubers from round to oval and long-oval shapes. Conversely, overexpression of StOFP20 in Spunta changed tuber shape from long to round. The most dramatic change from very long into round tubers was achieved by overexpression of StOFP20 in DM. Our results demonstrate that engineering potato tuber shape is readily achieved by modulating StOFP20 gene expression in a dose dependent manner, either by traditional breeding or by using genetic engineering methods.},

The method of instruction adopted in these books consists chiefly in guiding the reader by easy stages through a series of worked examples that are typical of the more common prob- lems amenable to analysis of variance that arise in the scientific or engineering field with which the author of the book concerned is con- versant."}

In this scenario, the structural asymmetry observed between the A, B and D subgenomes in hexaploid bread wheat derives from the cumulative effect of diploid progenitor divergence, the hybrid origin of the D subgenome, and subgenome partitioning following the polyploidization events.}

  abstract = {Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is a staple food crop and is considered one of the main sources of carbohydrates worldwide. Late blight (Phytophthora infestans) and common scab (Streptomyces scabies) are two of the primary production constraints faced by potato farming. Previous studies have identified a few resistance genes for both late blight and common scab; however, these genes explain only a limited fraction of the heritability of these diseases. Genomic selection has been demonstrated to be an effective methodology for breeding value prediction in many major crops (e.g., maize and wheat). However, the technology has received little attention in potato breeding. We present the first genomic selection study involving late blight and common scab in tetraploid potato. Our data involves 4,110 (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, SNPs) and phenotypic field evaluations for late blight (n=1,763) and common scab (n=3,885) collected in seven and nine years, respectively. We report moderately high genomic heritability estimates (0.46 ± 0.04 and 0.45 ± 0.017, for late blight and common scab, respectively). The extent of genotype-by-year interaction was high for late blight and low for common scab. Our assessment of prediction accuracy demonstrates the applicability of genomic prediction for tetraploid potato breeding. For both traits, we found that more than 90\% of the genetic variance could be captured with an additive model. For common scab, the highest prediction accuracy was achieved using an additive model. For late blight, small but statistically significant gains in prediction accuracy were achieved using a model that accounted for both additive and dominance effects. Using whole-genome regression models we identified SNPs located in previously reported hotspots regions for late blight, on genes associated with systemic disease resistance responses, and a new locus located in a WRKY transcription factor for common scab.},

Genomic selection addresses this complexity by including all markers in the prediction model. A key method for the genomic prediction of breeding values is ridge regression (RR), which is equivalent to best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) when the genetic covariance between lines is proportional to their similarity in genotype space.

To facilitate the use of RR and nonadditive kernels in plant breeding, a new software package for R called rrBLUP has been developed. At its core is a fast maximum-likelihood algorithm for mixed models with a single variance component besides the residual error, which allows for efficient prediction with unreplicated training data. Use of the rrBLUP software is demonstrated through several examples, including the identification of optimal crosses based on superior progeny value. In cross-validation tests, the prediction accuracy with nonadditive kernels was significantly higher than RR for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield but equivalent for several maize (Zea mays L.) traits.},

For outbred populations, the method called Optimum Contribution Selection (OCS) chooses parental contributions to maximize the average breeding value at a prescribed inbreeding rate. With Optimum Mate Allocation (OMA), the contribution of each mating is optimized, which allows for specific combining ability due to dominance.

A new Convex optimization framework for OMA, named COMA, was developed and released as public software. The effectiveness of COMA was demonstrated through stochastic simulation of a genomic selection program for 30 generations. Both pedigree and genomic kinship based on identity-by-descent performed similarly for OCS, but the realized inbreeding rate was too conservative when using genomic kinship for OMA. OMA predicted mate performance with higher accuracy (+0.2–0.3) than OCS, but this only translated into higher gain for the first 5 generations, reinforcing the idea that selection on additive value drives long-term gain. Less genic variance was used by OMA to achieve the same gain as OCS, making it more efficient. The sparsity of the OMA solution makes it attractive when random mating is logistically challenging. In a potato breeding case study with 170 candidates, the OMA solution at 1\% inbreeding required only 25 matings involving 29 parents.},

Significantly more genetic gain was realized with pedigree kinship, which is consistent with previous studies showing the selective advantage of an individual under OCS is dominated by its Mendelian sampling term. Despite the higher accuracy (+0.2–0.3) when predicting mate performance with OMA compared with OCS, there was little long-term gain advantage. The sparsity of the COMA mating design and flexibility to incorporate mating constraints offer practical incentives over OCS.

  abstract = {Many important traits in plant breeding are polygenic and therefore recalcitrant to traditional marker-assisted selection. Genomic selection addresses this complexity by including all markers in the prediction model. A key method for the genomic prediction of breeding values is ridge regression (RR), which is equivalent to best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) when the genetic covariance between lines is proportional to their similarity in genotype space. This additive model can be broadened to include epistatic effects by using other kernels, such as the Gaussian, which represent inner products in a complex feature space. To facilitate the use of RR and nonadditive kernels in plant breeding, a new software package for R called rrBLUP has been developed. At its core is a fast maximum-likelihood algorithm for mixed models with a single variance component besides the residual error, which allows for efficient prediction with unreplicated training data. Use of the rrBLUP software is demonstrated through several examples, including the identification of optimal crosses based on superior progeny value. In cross-validation tests, the prediction accuracy with nonadditive kernels was significantly higher than RR for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield but equivalent for several maize (Zea mays L.) traits.},

  abstract = {We describe extensions to the method of Pritchard et al. for inferring population structure from multilocus genotype data. Most importantly, we develop methods that allow for linkage between loci. The new model accounts for the correlations between linked loci that arise in admixed populations (“admixture linkage disequilibium”). This modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin of chromosomal regions, and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows identification of subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using the existing method. We present results applying the new methods to study admixture in African-Americans, recombination in Helicobacter pylori, and drift in populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The methods are implemented in a program, structure, version 2.0, which is available at http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu.},

  abstract = {Background: Classical genetic canalization models, which accommodate the mean and variance of a trait separately, provide a flexible approach to take heteroscedasticity for continuous traits into account. However, this model is not appropriate for discrete traits. The aim of this work was to propose heteroscedastic threshold models suitable for the genetic analysis of ordinal data. Methods: In order to first fit the mean and variance of ordinal traits separately, we extended the classical threshold model (TM) for discrete data by introducing non-genetic and genetic factors of heterogeneity on the variance of its underlying variable, which leads to a homothetic threshold model HTM and its alternative parameterization HTM' in which the thresholds of different individuals are linked by a homothetic-translation. Relaxing the constraint between the thresholds led us to propose an independent threshold model ITM that was more flexible than HTM' but required the estimation of more parameters. TM, HTM and ITM models were applied to study 19,671 records on litter size in Romane sheep. Results: Both HTM and ITM were able to disentangle the link between the mean and variance that holds in the classical homoscedastic threshold model. The results obtained for the litter size of Romane ewes showed that the data was best fitted with HTM compared to ITM and TM. The correlations between the observed and predicted variances were equal to 0.6 and 0.2 for HTM and TM, respectively. These analyses showed the existence of a genetic component for the heterogeneity of litter size in sheep that was taken into account in HTM. Conclusions: HTM is the most suitable model to study the variability of litter size in sheep. It accommodates both the mean and variance separately while requiring the estimation of only a few parameters.},

Oestrogen treatment has been found to improve memory in men awaiting gender reassignment and in post-menopausal women. OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of supervised high versus low soya diets on attention, memory and frontal lobe function in young healthy adults of both sexes. METHODS Student volunteers were randomly allocated to receive, under supervision, a high soya (100 mg total isoflavones/day) or a low soya (0.5 mg total isoflavones/day) diet for 10 weeks. They received a battery of cognitive tests at baseline and then after 10 weeks of diet. RESULTS Those receiving the high soya diet showed significant improvements in short-term (immediate recall of prose and 4-s delayed matching to sample of patterns) and long-term memory (picture recall after 20 min) and in mental flexibility (rule shifting and reversal). These improvements were found in males and females. In a letter fluency test and in a test of planning (Stockings of Cambridge), the high soya diet improved performance only in females. There was no effect of diet on tests of attention or in a category generation task. Those on the high soya diet rated themselves as more restrained and, after the tests of memory and attention, they became less tense than did those on the control diet. CONCLUSIONS Significant cognitive improvements can arise from a relatively brief dietary intervention, and the improvements from a high soya diet are not restricted to women or to verbal tasks.}

  abstract = {Background: After the extensive implementation of genomic selection (GS), the choice of the statistical model and data used to estimate variance components (VCs) remains unclear. A primary concern is that VCs estimated from a traditional pedigree-based animal model (P-AM) will be biased due to ignoring the impact of GS. The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of GS on estimates of VC in the analysis of different sets of phenotypes and to investigate VC estimation using different methods. Data were simulated to resemble the Danish Jersey population. The simulation included three phases: (1) a historical phase; (2) 20 years of conventional breeding; and (3) 15 years of GS. The three scenarios based on different sets of phenotypes for VC estimation were as follows: (1) Pheno1: phenotypes from only the conventional phase (1-20 years); (2) Pheno1 + 2: phenotypes from both the conventional phase and GS phase (1-35 years); (3) Pheno2: phenotypes from only the GS phase (21-35 years). Single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP), a single-step Bayesian regression model (ssBR), and P-AM were applied. Two base populations were defined: the first was the founder population referred to by the pedigree-based relationship (P-base); the second was the base population referred to by the current genotyped population (G-base). Results: In general, both the ssGBLUP and ssBR models with all the phenotypic and genotypic information (Pheno1 + 2) yielded biased estimates of additive genetic variance compared to the P-base model. When the phenotypes from the conventional breeding phase were excluded (Pheno2), P-AM led to underestimation of the genetic variance of P-base. Compared to the VCs of G-base, when phenotypes from the conventional breeding phase (Pheno2) were ignored, the ssBR model yielded unbiased estimates of the total genetic variance and marker-based genetic variance, whereas the residual variance was overestimated. Conclusions: The results show that neither of the single-step models (ssGBLUP and ssBR) can precisely estimate the VCs for populations undergoing GS. Overall, the best solution for obtaining unbiased estimates of VCs is to use P-AM with phenotypes from the conventional phase or phenotypes from both the conventional and GS phases.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background Multi-parent populations (MPPs) are important resources for studying plant genetic architecture and detecting quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In MPPs, the QTL effects can show various levels of allelic diversity, which can be an important factor influencing the detection of QTLs. In MPPs, the allelic effects can be more or less specific. They can depend on an ancestor, a parent or the combination of parents in a cross. In this paper, we evaluated the effect of QTL allelic diversity on the QTL detection power in MPPs. Results We simulated: a) cross-specific QTLs; b) parental and ancestral QTLs; and c) bi-allelic QTLs. Inspired by a real application in sugar beet, we tested different MPP designs (diallel, chessboard, factorial, and NAM) derived from five or nine parents to explore the ability to sample genetic diversity and detect QTLs. Using a fixed total population size, the QTL detection power was larger in MPPs with fewer but larger crosses derived from a reduced number of parents. The use of a larger set of parents was useful to detect rare alleles with a large phenotypic effect. The benefit of using a larger set of parents was however conditioned on an increase of the total population size. We also determined empirical confidence intervals for QTL location to compare the resolution of different designs. For QTLs representing 6\% of the phenotypic variation, using 1600 F 2 offspring individuals, we found average 95\% confidence intervals over different designs of 49 and 25 cM for cross-specific and bi-allelic QTLs, respectively. Conclusions MPPs derived from less parents with few but large crosses generally increased the QTL detection power. Using a larger set of parents to cover a wider genetic diversity can be useful to detect QTLs with a reduced minor allele frequency when the QTL effect is large and when the total population size is increased.},

We undertook a large-scale quantitative analysis to determine the genetic basis of the phenotypic diversity in wheat grain morphology. A high-throughput method was used to capture grain size and shape variation in multiple mapping populations, elite varieties, and a broad collection of ancestral wheat species. This analysis reveals that grain size and shape are largely independent traits in both primitive wheat and in modern varieties. This phenotypic structure was retained across the mapping populations studied, suggesting that these traits are under the control of a limited number of discrete genetic components. We identified the underlying genes as quantitative trait loci that are distinct for grain size and shape and are largely shared between the different mapping populations. Moreover, our results show a significant reduction of phenotypic variation in grain shape in the modern germplasm pool compared with the ancestral wheat species, probably as a result of a relatively recent bottleneck. Therefore, this study provides the genetic underpinnings of an emerging phenotypic model where wheat domestication has transformed a long thin primitive grain to a wider and shorter modern grain.},

  abstract = {Potato is a major global crop that has an important role to play in food security, reducing poverty and improving human nutrition. Enhanced atmospheric CO2 concentrations provide an opportunity to increase potato yields in the future, but this will only be possible if the potato crop can cope with the other consequences of climate change caused by this rise in CO2. While climate change may impact biotic stress either positively or negatively, abiotic stresses are likely to be greatly increased and become a major threat to potato production. Increasing heat, drought and salinity stress will drive the need for greater understanding of genes, traits and management techniques that allow potato to cope with these stresses. In this review, we identify some of the key physiological and molecular adaptations of potato to these stresses and propose an ideotype which should include (1) optimal stomatal regulation to balance water loss and heat stress in leaves, (2) production of metabolites and transporters to scavenge reactive oxygen species and partition toxic elements, (3) enhanced root systems to maximise water capture, (4) maintenance of tuberisation under stress conditions and (5) stress avoidance by accelerating crop development and reducing time to yield. We discuss potential ways to achieve this ideotype, emphasising the need to benefit from genetic diversity in landrace and wild material by screening for traits in combined stress environments appropriate to future agroecosystems.},

  abstract = {We identify three major components of spatial variation in plot errors from field experiments and extend the two-dimensional spatial procedures of Cullis and Gleeson (1991) to account for them. The components are nonstationary, large-scale (global) variation across the field, stationary variation within the trial (natural variation or local trend), and extraneous variation that is often induced by experimental procedures and is predominantly aligned with rows and columns. We present a strategy for identifying a model for the plot errors that uses a trellis plot of residuals, a perspective plot of the sample variogram and, where possible, likelihood ratio tests to identify which components are present. We demonstrate the strategy using two illustrative examples. We conclude that although there is no one model that adequately fits all field experiments, the separable autoregressive model is dominant. However, there is often additional identifiable variation present.}

  abstract = {A one-stage analysis of a series of variety trials involves a combined analysis of the individual plot data across trials. Together with prudent modelling of the genetic effects across trials, this is considered to be the gold standard analysis of multi-environment field trial data. An alternative is a two-stage approach in which the variety means from an analysis of the individual trials in stage one are combined into a weighted mixed model analysis in stage two to give the full set of predicted variety by environment effects and an estimate of their associated variance structure. The two-stage analysis will exactly reproduce the one-stage analysis if the full variance-covariance matrix of the means from stage one is known and is utilised in stage two. Typically the full matrix is not stored and a diagonal approximation is used. This introduces a compromise to the full analysis. The impacts of a diagonal approximation are greater in the presence of sophisticated models for the genetic effects. A second compromise is through a loss of information in estimating the non-genetic variance parameters using the two-stage approach. In this paper we draw a direct link between the one and two-stage analysis approaches for crop variety evaluation data in Australia. We now have the computing power to analyse large and complex multi-environment variety trial data sets using the one-stage approach without the need for a two-stage approximation. This should motivate a move away from the two-stage approach in a range of contexts.},

  abstract = {Background: The limited genetic diversity of elite maize germplasms raises concerns about the potential to breed for new challenges. Initiatives have been formed over the years to identify and utilize useful diversity from landraces to overcome this issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the proposed designs to initiate a pre-breeding program within the Seeds of Discovery (SeeD) initiative with emphasis on harnessing polygenic variation from landraces using genomic selection. We evaluated these designs with stochastic simulation to provide decision support about the effect of several design factors on the quality of resulting (pre-bridging) germplasm. The evaluated design factors were: i) the approach to initiate a pre-breeding program from the selected landraces, doubled haploids of the selected landraces, or testcrosses of the elite hybrid and selected landraces, ii) the genetic parameters of landraces and phenotypes, and iii) logistical factors related to the size and management of a pre-breeding program. Results: The results suggest a pre-breeding program should be initiated directly from landraces. Initiating from testcrosses leads to a rapid reconstruction of the elite donor genome during further improvement of the prebridging germplasm. The analysis of accuracy of genomic predictions across the various design factors indicate the power of genomic selection for pre-breeding programs with large genetic diversity and constrained resources for data recording. The joint effect of design factors was summarized with decision trees with easy to follow guidelines to optimize pre-breeding efforts of SeeD and similar initiatives. Conclusions: Results of this study provide guidelines for SeeD and similar initiatives on how to initiate pre-breeding programs that aim to harness polygenic variation from landraces.},

  abstract = {Background: The limited genetic diversity of elite maize germplasms raises concerns about the potential to breed for new challenges. Initiatives have been formed over the years to identify and utilize useful diversity from landraces to overcome this issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the proposed designs to initiate a pre-breeding program within the Seeds of Discovery (SeeD) initiative with emphasis on harnessing polygenic variation from landraces using genomic selection. We evaluated these designs with stochastic simulation to provide decision support about the effect of several design factors on the quality of resulting (pre-bridging) germplasm. The evaluated design factors were: i) the approach to initiate a pre-breeding program from the selected landraces, doubled haploids of the selected landraces, or testcrosses of the elite hybrid and selected landraces, ii) the genetic parameters of landraces and phenotypes, and iii) logistical factors related to the size and management of a pre-breeding program. Results: The results suggest a pre-breeding program should be initiated directly from landraces. Initiating from testcrosses leads to a rapid reconstruction of the elite donor genome during further improvement of the prebridging germplasm. The analysis of accuracy of genomic predictions across the various design factors indicate the power of genomic selection for pre-breeding programs with large genetic diversity and constrained resources for data recording. The joint effect of design factors was summarized with decision trees with easy to follow guidelines to optimize pre-breeding efforts of SeeD and similar initiatives. Conclusions: Results of this study provide guidelines for SeeD and similar initiatives on how to initiate pre-breeding programs that aim to harness polygenic variation from landraces.},

The consequences of propagule type on the plant architectural development and biomass partitioning in potato are not well known. We quantified architectural differences between plants grown from these two types of propagules from the same genotype, explicitly analysing branching dynamics above-ground and below-ground, and relate these differences to biomass allocation patterns. Methods A greenhouse experiment was conducted, using potato plants of the same genotype but grown from two types of propagules: true seed and seed tuber from a true-seed grown plant (seedling tuber). Architectural traits and biomass allocation to different organs were quantified at four developmental stages. Differences between true-seed-grown and seedling-tuber-grown plants were compared at whole-plant level, and at the level of individual stems and branches including their number, size and location on the plant. Key Results A more branched and compact architecture was produced in true-seed-grown plants, compared to seedling-tuber-grown plants. The architectural differences between plants grown from true seed and seedling tuber gradually appeared and were mainly attributed to the divergent temporal-spatial distribution of lateral branches above- and below-ground on the main axis. The continual production of branches in true-seed-grown plants indicated their indeterminate growth habit, which was also reflected in a slower shift of biomass allocation from above-ground to below-ground branches, while the opposite trend was found in seedling-tuber-grown plants. Conclusions In true-seed-grown plants, lateral branching was stronger and determined whole-plant architecture as well as plant function with regard to light interception and biomass production, compared with seedling-tuber-grown plants. This different role of branching indicates that a difference in preference between clonal and sexual reproduction may exist. The divergent branching behaviours in true-seed-grown and seedling-tuber-grown plants may be regulated by the different intensity of apical dominance, which suggests that the branching control can depend on propagule type.},

All the genotypes were grown in 3 replicates under the same agronomic conditions at the research farm of Agricultural University Peshawar. Genotypes strongly influenced (P \textbackslash textless 0.001) the nutrient composition of the straw except the crude protein contents. There were large differences (P \textbackslash textless 0.001) among the genotypes in the in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of straw varying from 36.40 to 48.36\%. Among the chemical components of straw, fiber fractions and NFE were significantly related to IVDMD. Significant differences (P \textbackslash textless 0.001) due to genotype were found in the botanical fractions of wheat straw. Leaf proportion was highly correlated with IVDMD (r = 0.84, P \textbackslash textless 0.001) and accounted for most of the variation in the digestibility of straw. The morphological characteristics were mostly unrelated to chemical components of the straw except crude fiber, ADF and NDF which showed negative correlations with leaf proportion and positive relationships with stem diameter and stem proportion. No relationship between grain yield and straw IVDMD was found and was genotype dependent which suggested that it should be possible to select wheat varieties that produce high quality straw without sacrifying grain yield. Increase in grain production was associated with enhanced straw yield (P \textbackslash textless 0.001). These observations demonstrate that wheat varieties can be identified which combine the desirable characteristics of high grain yield and high yield of superior quality straw. Among the 15 wheat genotypes, Pirsibaq-91 produced straw of higher digestibility (45.60\%) and at the same time gave maximum yield of both grain and straw (3.83 and 6.90 tons per hectare, respectively).

To identify a large number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in elite potato germplasm, we sequenced normalized cDNA prepared from three commercial potato cultivars: 'Atlantic', 'Premier Russet' and 'Snowden'.

Using the Maq SNP filter that filters read depth, density, and quality, 575,340 SNPs were identified within these three cultivars. In parallel, 2,358 SNPs were identified within existing Sanger sequences for three additional cultivars, 'Bintje', 'Kennebec', and 'Shepody'. Using a stringent set of filters in conjunction with the potato reference genome, we identified 69,011 high confidence SNPs from these six cultivars for use in genotyping with the Infinium platform. Ninety-six of these SNPs were used with a BeadXpress assay to assess allelic diversity in a germplasm panel of 248 lines; 82 of the SNPs proved sufficiently informative for subsequent analyses. Within diverse North American germplasm, the chip processing market class was most distinct, clearly separated from all other market classes. The round white and russet market classes both include fresh market and processing cultivars. Nevertheless, the russet and round white market classes are more distant from each other than processing are from fresh market types within these two groups. The genotype data generated in this study, albeit limited in number, has revealed distinct relationships among the market classes of potato. The SNPs identified in this study will enable high-throughput genotyping of germplasm and populations, which in turn will enable more efficient marker-assisted breeding efforts in potato.},

  abstract = {Objective: To examine the effectiveness of intermittent energy restriction in the treatment for overweight and obesity in adults, when compared to usual care treatment or no treatment. Introduction: Intermittent energy restriction encompasses dietary approaches including intermittent fasting, alternate day fasting, and fasting for two days per week. Despite the recent popularity of intermittent energy restriction and associated weight loss claims, the supporting evidence base is limited. Inclusion criteria: This review included overweight or obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) adults (≥18 years). Intermittent energy restriction was defined as consumption of ≤800 kcal on at least one day, but no more than six days per week. Intermittent energy restriction interventions were compared to no treatment (ad libitum diet) or usual care (continuous energy restriction ∼25\% of recommended energy intake). Included interventions had a minimum duration of 12 weeks from baseline to post outcome measurements. The types of studies included were randomized and pseudo-randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome of this review was change in body weight. Secondary outcomes included: i) anthropometric outcomes (change in BMI, waist circumference, fat mass, fat free mass); ii) cardio-metabolic outcomes (change in blood glucose and insulin, lipoprotein profiles and blood pressure); and iii) lifestyle outcomes: diet, physical activity, quality of life and adverse events. Methods: A systematic search was conducted from database inception to November 2015. The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN registry, and anzctr.org.au for English language published studies, protocols and trials. Two independent reviewers evaluated the methodological quality of included studies using the standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data were extracted from papers included in the review by two independent reviewers using the standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Effect sizes were expressed as weighted mean differences and their 95\% confidence intervals were calculated for meta-analyses. Results: Six studies were included in this review. The intermittent energy restriction regimens varied across studies and included alternate day fasting, fasting for two days, and up to four days per week. The duration of studies ranged from three to 12 months. Four studies included continuous energy restriction as a comparator intervention and two studies included a no treatment control intervention. Meta-analyses showed that intermittent energy restriction was more effective than no treatment for weight loss (−4.14 kg; 95\% CI −6.30 kg to −1.99 kg; p ≤ 0.001). Although both treatment interventions achieved similar changes in body weight (approximately 7 kg), the pooled estimate for studies that investigated the effect of intermittent energy restriction in comparison to continuous energy restriction revealed no significant difference in weight loss (−1.03 kg; 95\% CI −2.46 kg to 0.40 kg; p = 0.156). Conclusions: Intermittent energy restriction may be an effective strategy for the treatment of overweight and obesity. Intermittent energy restriction was comparable to continuous energy restriction for short term weight loss in overweight and obese adults. Intermittent energy restriction was shown to be more effective than no treatment, however, this should be interpreted cautiously due to the small number of studies and future research is warranted to confirm the findings of this review.},

During the rearing period, chicks were housed under two levels of light: dim light (i.e., 5 lx) and bright light (i.e., 60 to 80 lx) and two beak conditions: with or without trimming. At 15 wk of age, all birds were transferred to laying cages with five birds per cage. At 17 wk of age, four diets containing different concentrations of dietary fiber were offered: a commercial (wheat) diet, high insoluble fiber (millrun) diet, high soluble fiber (barley) diet, and high soluble fiber diet plus enzyme. Beak trimming had a profound effect (P {$<$} 0.001) on cannibalism with mortality occurring predominantly in untrimmed birds.

We are beginning to understand the synthesis of these major wall components individually, but still have a poor understanding of how the cell wall components are assembled into complex matrices. Valuable insight has been gained by examining intact components to understand the individual elements that make up plant cell walls. Grasses are a prominent group within the plant kingdom, not only for their important roles in global agriculture, but also for the complexity of their cell walls. Ferulate incorporation into grass cell wall matrices (C3 and C4 types) leads to a cross-linked matrix that plays a prominent role in the structure and utilization of grass biomass compared to dicot species. Incorporation of p-coumarates as part of the lignin structure also adds to the complexity of grass cell walls. Feruoylation results in a wall with individual hemicellulosic polysaccharides (arabinoxylans) covalently linked to each other and to lignin. Evidence strongly suggests that ferulates not only cross-link arabinoxylans, but may be important factors in lignification of the cell wall. Therefore, the distribution of ferulates on arabinoxylans could provide a means of structuring regions of the matrix with the incorporation of lignin and have a significant impact upon localized cell wall organization. The role of other phenolics in cell wall formation such as p-coumarates (which can have concentrations higher than ferulates) remains unknown. It is possible that p-coumarates assist in the formation of lignin, especially syringyl rich lignin. The uniqueness of the grass cell wall compared to dicot sepcies may not be so much in the gross composition of the wall, but how the distinctive individual components are organized into a functional wall matrix. These features are discussed and working models are provided to illustrate how changing the organization of feruoylation and p-coumaroylation could lead to differing cell wall properties.},

  abstract = {The potential yield of potato is defined as the theoretical yield that can be assessed for a well-adapted cultivar, grown from the best possible seed under optimal conditions. More than in crops that are grown from generative seeds, the growth, development, yield and quality of the potato crop are strongly influenced by the quality of the seed tubers, including their genetic, physical and physiological quality and their seed health status. Potato is very variable in maturity type: late cultivars can intercept large quantities of light whereas early cultivars show more efficient resource use. We describe potential and actual yields as well as impact of climate change on these yields, based on simple, robust models. Potential yields may be as high as 160Mgha\textsuperscript{-1}, in production systems with abundant irrigation, high radiation levels and long seasons. In such systems, actual yields of above 120Mgha\textsuperscript{-1} are feasible. However, potato is also grown as a short-cycle crop and in those conditions potential and actual yields are much lower. Potential yields might not change much in potato over time, but there is still a large gap between actual and potential yields to fill. The ratio between actual and potential yield ranges from 10 to 75\%, but typical values are between 30 and 40\%, although they obviously depend on the level of input. These ratios allow great yield improvements provided inputs are economically feasible in practice and if climate change does not interfere. In most countries, yields of potato might increase by climate change, provided water supply remains adequate. Main changes through climate change will probably occur by changes in the number of growing days per crop cycle. In some areas with abundant potato production, such as the Indo-Gangetic plains, however, climate change might reduce yield because of a reduction in number of growing days, but it has been projected that the effects of climate change on potato will be regionally diverse.},

  abstract = {This review charts the use of the concept of harvest index in crop improvement and physiology, concentrating on the literature from the last 20 years. Evidence from abstract journals indicates that the term has been applied most to small grain cereal crops and pulses, in India, Western Europe and the USA, and that it has been less useful for maize and tuber crops. Standard methods of measuring harvest index, the associated problems of measurement and interpretation, and representative values for a range of world species are reviewed. The values for modern varieties of most intensively‐cultivated grain crops fall within the range 0.4 to 0.6. Variation between varieties of the same species is illustrated by trends in the harvest indices of old, outclassed and recent varieties of temperate and mediterranean wheat and barley (compared under uniform conditions); this shows a progressive increase throughout the present century, although improvement has been much slower in Australia and Canada than in the UK. In most cases, the improvement in harvest index has been a consequence of increased grain population density coupled with stable individual grain weight. The high heritability of harvest index is explored by examining its (rather weak) response to variation in environmental factors (fertilisation, population density, application of growth regulators) in the absence of severe stress. A fuller perspective is gained by reviewing aspects of the harvest index of rice, maize and tropical pulses. With rice, attention must be paid to the fact that the adhering lemma and palea (not primarily part of economic yield) can make up 20\% of grain weight; and there are important interactions among biomass, grain yield and season length. Maize differs from most small grain crops in that harvest index (in N. American varieties) was already high at the start of this century, and increases in yield potential have been largely the consequence of increased biomass production. The harvest index of many pulse species and varieties tends to be low because selection has been for some yield in all seasons. Extension of the harvest index concept to express the partitioning of mineral nutrients as well as dry matter (e.g. the nitrogen harvest index) has provided a range of responses whose implications for production and breeding remain to be explored. It is concluded that even though the principal cereal crops appear to be approaching the upper limit of harvest index, and future yield gains will have to be sought by increased biomass production, there will still be a need for the concept of harvest index as a tool in interpreting crop response to different environments and climatic change.

  abstract = {Background Drought is one of the major constraints for plant productivity worldwide. Different mechanisms of drought-tolerance have been reported for several plant species including maize. However, the differences in global gene expression between drought-tolerant and susceptible genotypes and their relationship to physiological adaptations to drought are largely unknown. The study of the differences in global gene expression between tolerant and susceptible genotypes could provide important information to design more efficient breeding programs to produce maize varieties better adapted to water limiting conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings Changes in physiological responses and gene expression patterns were studied under drought stress and recovery in three Mexican maize landraces which included two drought tolerant (Cajete criollo and Michoacán 21) and one susceptible (85-2) genotypes. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, soil and leaf water potentials were monitored throughout the experiment and microarray analysis was carried out on transcripts obtained at 10 and 17 days following application of stress and after recovery irrigation. The two tolerant genotypes show more drastic changes in global gene expression which correlate with different physiological mechanisms of adaptation to drought. Differences in the kinetics and number of up- and down-regulated genes were observed between the tolerant and susceptible maize genotypes, as well as differences between the two tolerant genotypes. Interestingly, the most dramatic differences between the tolerant and susceptible genotypes were observed during recovery irrigation, suggesting that the tolerant genotypes activate mechanisms that allow more efficient recovery after a severe drought. Conclusions/Significance A correlation between levels of photosynthesis and transcription under stress was observed and differences in the number, type and expression levels of transcription factor families were also identified under drought and recovery between the three maize landraces. Gene expression analysis suggests that the drought tolerant landraces have a greater capacity to rapidly modulate more genes under drought and recovery in comparison to the susceptible landrace. Modulation of a greater number of differentially expressed genes of different TF gene families is an important characteristic of the tolerant genotypes.

  abstract = {The potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) processing industry needs cultivars with high tuber specific gravity and acceptable color of processed product. All of the cultivars with high specific gravity currently grown in the U.S. are very closely related, which increases their genetic vulnerability and results in inbreeding as efforts are made to improve these traits. The use of diploid Solanum sp. in breeding may resolve these problems. The purposes of this study were (1) to estimate narrow-sense heritability for yield and specific gravity in random-mating diploid hybrid potato populations orS. phureja-S. stenotomum (PHU-STN) following two cycles of recurrent selection, (2) to examine phenotypic variances for yield and specific gravity following two cycles of recurrent selection within PHU-STN, (3) to compare the yield and specific gravity of individual PHU-STN clones with Atlantic, and (4) to screen these PHU-STN clones for the presence of 2n pollen. Four clones from each of 72 maternal half-sib families were evaluated for yield and specific gravity in replicated field tests in 1990 and 1991. A second selection cycle, using a randomly mated population obtained from the highest specific gravity clone in each maternal half-sib family, was similarly evaluated for yield and specific gravity in replicated field tests in 1995 and 1996. Narrow-sense heritability for specific gravity was estimated as 0.37 + 0.25 and 0.43 \_+ 0.27, in the first and second selection cycles, respectively, with a 27\% decrease in phenotypic variance. Narrow-sense heritability for yield was estimated as 0.60 + 0.26 and 0.06-+ 0.24, in the first and second selection cycles, respectively, with a 73\% decrease in phenotypic variance. There were significant correlations between yield and specific gravity in 1990 (r=0.32) and 1996 (r-0.37), but not 1991 (r=0.08) and 1995 (r=0.05). These results indicate that additional breeding efforts in this PHU-STN population could result in improvements in specific gravity. However, the amount of variation for yield in this population is decreasing and may indicate that the yield potential of this population is rapidly approaching its limit. In the second selection cycle, many of the 288 clones were significantly higher in specific gravity than the high-specific-gravity cultivar Atlantic, but none were higher yielding. Fifty-eight clones from the second selection cycle produced at least 5\% 2n pollen. When used in tetraploid x diploid hybridizations, this diploid population could furnish new genetic material to the tetraploid potato germplasm base for simultaneously increasing specific gravity and yield.},

Commonly employed MAS strategies, however, are not well suited for agronomically important complex traits, requiring extra time for eld-based phenotyping to identify agronomically superior lines. Genomic selection (GS) is an emerging alternative to MAS that uses all marker information to calculate genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) for complex traits. Selections are made directly on GEBV without further phenotyping. We developed an analytical framework to (i) compare gains from MAS and GS for complex traits and (ii) provide a plant breeding context for interpreting results from studies on GEBV accuracy. We designed MAS and GS breeding strategies with equal budgets for a high-investment maize (Zea mays L.) program and a low-investment winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) program. Results indicate that GS can outperform MAS on a per-year basis even at low GEBV accuracies. Using a previously reported GEBV accuracy of 0.53 for net merit in dairy cattle, expected annual gain from GS exceeded that of MAS by about threefold for maize and twofold for winter wheat. We conclude that if moderate selection accuracies can be achieved, GS could dramatically accelerate genetic gain through its shorter breeding cycle.},

  abstract = {Sire evaluation can logically be formulated as a process of prediction of future progeny of a sire produced by matings with specified females and making their records in some specified environment. Sewall Wright (1931) over 40 years ago suggested three types of prediction that might be of interest: (1) progeny of a particular mating, (2) future daughters in the same herd but out of a new sample of dams, (3) daughters out of a random sample of dams of the breed. Dr. Lush as early as 1931 had elucidated the principles of sire evaluation, Lush (1931 Lush (1933).As was pointed out by Lehman (1961), two types of selection problems have been studied by statisticians. These are Model I and Model II selection, analagous to the corresponding models of analysis of variance. In Model I the candidates for selection are fixed, for example, choices are to be made among treatments, a random sample of observations having been taken on each fixed treatment. No really unified theory has been developed for this type of selection. In contrast, Model II selection involves candidates that are regarded as a random sample from some specified population. Model II represents the classical selection problem in animal breeding and had essentially been solved by Wright and Lush early in the 1930's. Smith's (1936) application to plant breeding and, in particular, Hazel's (1943) application to animal breeding formalized the techniques.A third type of selection that has apparently been overlooked by both statisticians and animal breeders might},

To accurately predict phenotypes and assay genetic diversity, molecular markers should assay a representative sample of the polymorphisms in the population under study. Ascertainment bias arises when marker data is not obtained from a random sample of the polymorphisms in the population of interest.

This study compared GBS and DArT marker platforms for measuring genetic diversity and genomic selection (GS) accuracy in elite U.S. soft winter wheat. From a set of 365 breeding lines, 38,412 single nucleotide polymorphism GBS markers were discovered and genotyped. The GBS SNPs gave a higher GS accuracy than 1,544 DArT markers on the same lines, despite 43.9\% missing data. Using a bootstrap approach, we observed significantly more clustering of markers and ascertainment bias with DArT relative to GBS. The minor allele frequency distribution of GBS markers had a deficit of rare variants compared to DArT markers. Despite the ascertainment bias of the DArT markers, GS accuracy for three traits out of four was not significantly different when an equal number of markers were used for each platform. This suggests that the gain in accuracy observed using GBS compared to DArT markers was mainly due to a large increase in the number of markers available for the analysis.},

Breeding efforts have relied on phenotypic selection of populations developed from intra-and intermarket class crosses and introgressions of wild and cultivated Solanum relatives. To retrospectively explore the effects of potato breeding at the genome level, we used 8303 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers to genotype a 250- line diversity panel composed of wild species, genetic stocks, and cultivated potato lines with release dates ranging from 1857 to 2011.

Modern breeding efforts have scarcely changed the percentage of heterozygous loci or the frequency of homozygous, single-dose, and duplex loci on a genome level, despite concerted efforts by breeders. In contrast, clear selection in less than 50 years of breeding was observed for alleles in biosynthetic pathways important for market class-specific traits such as pigmentation and carbohydrate composition. Although improvement and diversification for distinct market classes was observed through whole-genome analysis of historic and current potato lines, an increased rate of gain from selection will be required to meet growing global food demands and challenges due to climate change.

  abstract = {Ridge regression with heteroscedastic marker variances provides an alternative to Bayesian genome-wide prediction methods. Our objectives were to suggest new methods to determine marker-specific shrinkage factors for heteroscedastic ridge regression and to investigate their properties with respect to computational efficiency and accuracy of estimated effects. We analyzed published data sets of maize, wheat, and sugar beet as well as simulated data with the new methods. Ridge regression with shrinkage factors that were proportional to single-marker analysis of variance estimates of variance components (i.e., RRWA) was the fastest method. It required computation times of less than 1 sec for medium-sized data sets, which have dimensions that are common in plant breeding. A modification of the expectation-maximization algorithm that yields heteroscedastic marker variances (i.e., RMLV) resulted in the most accurate marker effect estimates. It outperformed the homoscedastic ridge regression approach for best linear unbiased prediction in particular for situations with high marker density and strong linkage disequilibrium along the chromosomes, a situation that occurs often in plant breeding populations. We conclude that the RRWA and RMLV approaches provide alternatives to the commonly used Bayesian methods, in particular for applications in which computational feasibility or accuracy of effect estimates are important, such as detection or functional analysis of genes or planning crosses.},

  abstract = {Ridge regression with heteroscedastic marker variances provides an alternative to Bayesian genome-wide prediction methods. Our objectives were to suggest new methods to determine marker-specific shrinkage factors for heteroscedastic ridge regression and to investigate their properties with respect to computational efficiency and accuracy of estimated effects. We analyzed published data sets of maize, wheat, and sugar beet as well as simulated data with the new methods. Ridge regression with shrinkage factors that were proportional to single-marker analysis of variance estimates of variance components (i.e., RRWA) was the fastest method. It required computation times of less than 1 sec for medium-sized data sets, which have dimensions that are common in plant breeding. A modification of the expectation-maximization algorithm that yields heteroscedastic marker variances (i.e., RMLV) resulted in the most accurate marker effect estimates. It outperformed the homoscedastic ridge regression approach for best linear unbiased prediction in particular for situations with high marker density and strong linkage disequilibrium along the chromosomes, a situation that occurs often in plant breeding populations. We conclude that the RRWA and RMLV approaches provide alternatives to the commonly used Bayesian methods, in particular for applications in which computational feasibility or accuracy of effect estimates are important, such as detection or functional analysis of genes or planning crosses.},

  abstract = {Potato is the most important non-cereal crop worldwide, and, yet, genetic gains in potato have been traditionally delayed by the crop’s biology, mostly the genetic heterozygosity of autotetraploid cultivars and the intricacies of the reproductive system. Novel site-directed genetic modification techniques provide opportunities for designing climate-smart cultivars, but they also pose new possibilities (and challenges) for breeding potato. As potato species show a remarkable reproductive diversity, and their ovules have a propensity to develop apomixis-like phenotypes, tinkering with reproductive genes in potato is opening new frontiers in potato breeding. Developing diploid varieties instead of tetraploid ones has been proposed as an alternative way to fill the gap in genetic gain, that is being achieved by using gene-edited self-compatible genotypes and inbred lines to exploit hybrid seed technology. In a similar way, modulating the formation of unreduced gametes and synthesizing apomixis in diploid or tetraploid potatoes may help to reinforce the transition to a diploid hybrid crop or enhance introgression schemes and fix highly heterozygous genotypes in tetraploid varieties. In any case, the induction of apomixis-like phenotypes will shorten the time and costs of developing new varieties by allowing the multi-generational propagation through true seeds. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on potato reproductive phenotypes and underlying genes, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using potato’s natural variability to modulate reproductive steps during seed formation, and consider strategies to synthesize apomixis. However, before we can fully modulate the reproductive phenotypes, we need to understand the genetic basis of such diversity. Finally, we visualize an active, central role for genebanks in this endeavor by phenotyping properly genotyped genebank accessions and new introductions to provide scientists and breeders with reliable data and resources for developing innovations to exploit market opportunities.},

Since the S locus has been localized on chromosome 1 on the potato RFLP map, it is confirmed that the Sli gene is independent of the S locus.},

We evaluated the agronomic traits of 22 hybrid families grown in small and large pots and the field. These families were derived from crosses of heterozygous × heterozygous, homozygous × heterozygous, and homozygous × homozygous parents using highly homozygous plants of Solanum phureja, S. chacoense, and tenth selfed generation plants derived from an interspecific hybrid. Genetic variability was estimated using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Hybrid populations from homozygous × homozygous parents exhibited the highest phenotypic and genetic uniformity levels. Hybrid vigor in hybrids of homozygous × homozygous parents was tremendously enormous for fecundity and growth (up to 2877.5\% and 8153.6\%, respectively) and moderately large for tuber yield (158.2 to 230.7\%). SNP-based genome-wide percent heterozygosity ranged from 28.7 to 44.3\% for heterozygous parents and 14.4 to 44.8\% for hybrid populations.},

Here, computer simulation is used to study an alternative analysis that does not require centering genotypes but fits the mean μg of unselected individuals as a fixed effect. Starting with observed diplotypes from 721 cattle, a five-generation population was simulated with sire selection to produce 40,000 individuals with phenotypes, of which the 1000 sires had genotypes.

Evaluations were undertaken with (J) or without (N) μg when marker covariates were not centered; and with (JC) or without (C) μg when all observed and imputed marker covariates were centered. Centering did not influence accuracy of genomic prediction, but fitting μg did. Accuracies were improved when the panel comprised only quantitative trait loci (QTL); models JC and J had accuracies of 99.4\%, whereas models C and N had accuracies of 90.2\%. When only markers were in the panel, the 4 models had accuracies of 80.4\%. In panels that included QTL, fitting μg in the model improved accuracy, but had little impact when the panel contained only markers. In populations undergoing selection, fitting μg in the model is recommended to avoid bias and reduction in prediction accuracy due to selection.},

  abstract = {Wheat is one of the most widely grown crop in temperate climates for food and animal feed. In order to meet the demands of the predicted population increase in an ever-changing climate, wheat production needs to dramatically increase. Spike and grain traits are critical determinants of final yield and grain uniformity a commercially desired trait, but their analysis is laborious and often requires destructive harvest. One of the current challenges is to develop an accurate, non-destructive method for spike and grain trait analysis capable of handling large populations. In this study we describe the development of a robust method for the accurate extraction and measurement of spike and grain morphometric parameters from images acquired by X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT). The image analysis pipeline developed automatically identifies plant material of interest in μCT images, performs image analysis, and extracts morphometric data. As a proof of principle, this integrated methodology was used to analyse the spikes from a population of wheat plants subjected to high temperatures under two different water regimes. Temperature has a negative effect on spike height and grain number with the middle of the spike being the most affected region. The data also confirmed that increased grain volume was correlated with the decrease in grain number under mild stress. Being able to quickly measure plant phenotypes in a non-destructive manner is crucial to advance our understanding of gene function and the effects of the environment. We report on the development of an image analysis pipeline capable of accurately and reliably extracting spike and grain traits from crops without the loss of positional information. This methodology was applied to the analysis of wheat spikes can be readily applied to other economically important crop species.},

  abstract = {Wheat is one of the most widely grown crop in temperate climates for food and animal feed. In order to meet the demands of the predicted population increase in an ever-changing climate, wheat production needs to dramatically increase. Spike and grain traits are critical determinants of final yield and grain uniformity a commercially desired trait, but their analysis is laborious and often requires destructive harvest. One of the current challenges is to develop an accurate, non-destructive method for spike and grain trait analysis capable of handling large populations. In this study we describe the development of a robust method for the accurate extraction and measurement of spike and grain morphometric parameters from images acquired by X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT). The image analysis pipeline developed automatically identifies plant material of interest in μCT images, performs image analysis, and extracts morphometric data. As a proof of principle, this integrated methodology was used to analyse the spikes from a population of wheat plants subjected to high temperatures under two different water regimes. Temperature has a negative effect on spike height and grain number with the middle of the spike being the most affected region. The data also confirmed that increased grain volume was correlated with the decrease in grain number under mild stress. Being able to quickly measure plant phenotypes in a non-destructive manner is crucial to advance our understanding of gene function and the effects of the environment. We report on the development of an image analysis pipeline capable of accurately and reliably extracting spike and grain traits from crops without the loss of positional information. This methodology was applied to the analysis of wheat spikes can be readily applied to other economically important crop species.},

Here we introduce entropy-based founder informativeness(EFI), a new measure of information content generalized across pedigrees, maps, marker systems and mating configurations. We derived equations for inbred-and outbred-derived mapping populations. Mathematical properties of EFI include enhanced sensitivity to mapping population type and extension to any number of founders. To illustrate the use of EFI, we compared experimental designs for QTL mapping for three examples : (i) different marker systems for an F 2 pedigree, (ii) different marker densities and sampling sizes for a BC 1 pedigree and (iii) a comparison of haplotypic versus zygotic analyses of an outbred pedigree. As an a priori generalized measure of information content, EFI does not require phenotypic data for optimizing experimental designs for QTL mapping.},

Nonetheless, many least-squares statistical tests depend on the variance of the sum of residuals, which by the Central Limit Theorem converge to a Gaussian distribution for large sample sizes. Therefore, least-squares LMs will likely have good performance in assessing the statistical significance of regression coefficients. Using simulations of count data, I compared GLM approaches for testing whether regression coefficients differ from zero with the traditional approach of applying LMs to transformed data. Simulations assumed that variation among sample populations was either (i) negative binomial or (ii) log-normal Poisson (i.e. log-normal variation among populations that were then sampled by a Poisson distribution). I used the simulated data to conduct tests of the hypotheses that regression coefficients differed from zero; I did not investigate statistical properties of the coefficient estimators, such as bias and precision. For negative binomial simulations whose assumptions closely matched the GLMs, the GLMs were nonetheless prone to type I errors (false positives) especially when there was more than one predictor (independent) variable. After correcting for type I errors, however, the GLMs provided slightly better statistical power than LMs. For log-normal-Poisson simulations, both a GLMM and the LMs performed well, but under some simulated conditions the GLMs had high type I error rates, a deadly sin for statistical tests. These results show that, while GLMs have slight advantages in power when they are properly specified, they can lead to badly wrong conclusions about the significance of regression coefficients if they are mis-specified.

  abstract = {Heterosis refers to the phenomenon that progeny of diverse varieties of a species or crosses between species exhibit greater biomass, speed of development, and fertility than both parents. Various models have been posited to explain heterosis, including dominance, overdominance, and pseudo-overdominance. In this Perspective, we consider that it might be useful to the field to abandon these terms that by their nature constrain data interpretation and instead attempt a progression to a quantitative genetic framework involving interactions in hierarchical networks. While we do not provide a comprehensive model to explain the phenomenology of heterosis, we provide the details of what needs to be explained and a direction of pursuit that we feel should be fruitful.},

While both types of germplasm are used in breeding programs, there are several advantages to using wild relatives. Diploid relatives are typically crossed with haploids (2n = 2x = 24) from tetraploid S. tuberosum to improve daylength adaptation. Most haploids are male sterile, so they are typically used as female parents. Cultivated diploids, such as members of the Phureja Group, produce male sterile hybrids when crossed as females to haploids; wild relatives, such as S. tarijense, often produce male fertile hybrids. Tuber yield following crosses of haploids to cultivated or wild relatives is often high. However, cultivated relatives generally produce hybrids with a high set of small tubers; hybrids from wild relatives are variable, but many are similar to cultivars in tuber size and set. While tubers of hybrids from cultivated relatives are typically rough, with deep eyes and raised internodes, those from wild relatives are often smooth. Tuber dormancy in hybrids with cultivated relatives is generally short, while that in hybrids with wild species is longer, allowing for storage over winter. Finally, resistance to several major diseases and stresses has been found in wild species and their hybrids with S. tuberosum haploids.

  abstract = {“Sparse testing” refers to reduced multi-environment breeding trials in which not all genotypes of interest are grown in each environment. Using genomic-enabled prediction and a model embracing genotype × environment interaction (GE), the non-observed genotype-in-environment combinations can be predicted. Consequently, the overall costs can be reduced and the testing capacities can be increased. The accuracy of predicting the unobserved data depends on different factors including (1) how many genotypes overlap between environments, (2) in how many environments each genotype is grown, and (3) which prediction method is used. In this research, we studied the predictive ability obtained when using a fixed number of plots and different sparse testing designs. The considered designs included the extreme cases of (1) no overlap of genotypes between environments, and (2) complete overlap of the genotypes between environments. In the latter case, the prediction set fully consists of genotypes that have not been tested at all. Moreover, we gradually go from one extreme to the other considering (3) intermediates between the two previous cases with varying numbers of different or non-overlapping (NO)/overlapping (O) genotypes. The empirical study is built upon two different maize hybrid data sets consisting of different genotypes crossed to two different testers (T1 and T2) and each data set was analyzed separately. For each set, phenotypic records on yield from three different environments are available. Three different prediction models were implemented, two main effects models (M1 and M2), and a model (M3) including GE. The results showed that the genome-based model including GE (M3) captured more phenotypic variation than the models that did not include this component. Also, M3 provided higher prediction accuracy than models M1 and M2 for the different allocation scenarios. Reducing the size of the calibration sets decreased the prediction accuracy under all allocation designs with M3 being the less affected model; however, using the genome-enabled models (i.e., M2 and M3) the predictive ability is recovered when more genotypes are tested across environments. Our results indicate that a substantial part of the testing resources can be saved when using genome-based models including GE for optimizing sparse testing designs.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY Polyploidy occurs in some animals and all flowering plants, including important crops such as wheat. The consequences of polyploidy in crops remain elusive, partly because their progenitors are unknown. Using two resynthesized wheat allotetraploids S l S l AA and AADD with known diploid progenitors, we analyzed mRNA and small RNA transcriptomes in the endosperm, compared transcriptomes between endosperm and root in AADD, and examined chromatin changes in the allotetraploids. In the endosperm, there were more non-additively expressed genes in S l S l AA than in AADD. In AADD, non-additively expressed genes were developmentally regulated, and the majority (62–70\%) were repressed. The repressed genes in AADD included a group of histone methyltransferase gene homologs, which correlated with reduced histone H3K9me2 levels and activation of various transposable elements in AADD. In S l S l AA, there was a tendency for expression dominance of S l over A homoeologs, but the histone methyltransferase gene homologs were additively expressed, correlating with insignificant changes in histone H3K9me2 levels. Moreover, more 24-nucleotide small inferring RNAs (siRNAs) in the A subgenome were disrupted in AADD than in S l S l AA, which were associated with expression changes of siRNA-associated genes. Our results indicate that asym-metrical changes in siRNAs, chromatin modifications, transposons and gene expression coincide with unstable AADD genomes and stable S l S l AA genomes, which could help explain the evolutionary trajectories of wheat allotetraploids formed by different progenitors.},

To investigate the impact of selection on variants distributed among homoeologous wheat genomes and to build a foundation for understanding genotype-phenotype relationships, we performed population-scale re-sequencing of a diverse panel of wheat lines. RESULTS A sample of 62 diverse lines was re-sequenced using the whole exome capture and genotyping-by-sequencing approaches. We describe the allele frequency, functional significance, and chromosomal distribution of 1.57 million single nucleotide polymorphisms and 161,719 small indels. Our results suggest that duplicated homoeologous genes are under purifying selection. We find contrasting patterns of variation and inter-variant associations among wheat genomes; this, in addition to demographic factors, could be explained by differences in the effect of directional selection on duplicated homoeologs. Only a small fraction of the homoeologous regions harboring selected variants overlapped among the wheat genomes in any given wheat line. These selected regions are enriched for loci associated with agronomic traits detected in genome-wide association studies. CONCLUSIONS Evidence suggests that directional selection in allopolyploids rarely acted on multiple parallel advantageous mutations across homoeologous regions, likely indicating that a fitness benefit could be obtained by a mutation at any one of the homoeologs. Additional advantageous variants in other homoelogs probably either contributed little benefit, or were unavailable in populations subjected to directional selection. We hypothesize that allopolyploidy may have increased the likelihood of beneficial allele recovery by broadening the set of possible selection targets.}

  abstract = {The recent invention of hybrid breeding technology for potato has led to an increased interest in hybrid potato R\&D. Hybrid true potato seeds (TPS) are used to produce planting materials such as transplants and seedling tubers, but can also be used for direct seeding of seed or ware crops. Transplants and seedling tubers can be used to produce seed tubers or ware tubers. The rise in R\&D in hybrid breeding creates the need for phenological scales of growth and development of plants produced by the various planting material types of hybrid-TPS. The BBCH (Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt and CHemical Industry) scale is one of the phenological scales developed for the description of the growth and development stages of plants. In 1993, a BBCH scale with descriptions for potato plants was released. The original BBCH scale gave standardised descriptions for TPS- and tuber-grown plants. Differences in the morphology of plants originating from the different planting materials in terms of types of branches and differences in below-ground growth and development were not included. Moreover, for reproductive growth stages, crucial for hybrid breeding, the original scale is incomplete as it does not carefully take the complex sympodial branching into account. Methods of describing growth of tubers and berries are complex and impossible to use when final tuber mass or berry size is unknown. The current paper augments the original BBCH scale, while retaining its structure and logic. It provides alternative and comprehensive descriptions of growth stages suitable for potato plants grown from different types of planting materials, and for all end uses of these plants. The proposed scale is detailed enough for research and breeding but still general enough for agricultural use.},

  abstract = {Genomewide association mapping in model organisms such as inbred mouse strains is a promising approach for the identification of risk factors related to human diseases. However, genetic association studies in inbred model organisms are confronted by the problem of complex population structure among strains. This induces inflated false positive rates, which cannot be corrected using standard approaches applied in human association studies such as genomic control or structured association. Recent studies demonstrated that mixed models successfully correct for the genetic relatedness in association mapping in maize and Arabidopsis panel data sets. However, the currently available mixed-model methods suffer from computational inefficiency. In this article, we propose a new method, efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), which corrects for population structure and genetic relatedness in model organism association mapping. Our method takes advantage of the specific nature of the optimization problem in applying mixed models for association mapping, which allows us to substantially increase the computational speed and reliability of the results. We applied EMMA to in silico whole-genome association mapping of inbred mouse strains involving hundreds of thousands of SNPs, in addition to Arabidopsis and maize data sets. We also performed extensive simulation studies to estimate the statistical power of EMMA under various SNP effects, varying degrees of population structure, and differing numbers of multiple measurements per strain. Despite the limited power of inbred mouse association mapping due to the limited number of available inbred strains, we are able to identify significantly associated SNPs, which fall into known QTL or genes identified through previous studies while avoiding an inflation of false positives. An R package implementation and webserver of our EMMA method are publicly available.},

Initially, wheat straw was hydrothermally liberated to a cellulose rich fiber fraction and a hemicellulose rich liquid fraction (hydrolysate). Enzymatic hydrolysis and subsequent fermentation of cellulose yielded 0.41g-ethanol/g-glucose, while dark fermentation of hydrolysate produced 178.0ml-H2/g-sugars. The effluents from both bioethanol and biohydrogen processes were further used to produce methane with the yields of 0.324 and 0.381m3/kg volatile solids (VS)added, respectively. Additionally, evaluation of six different wheat straw-to-biofuel production scenaria showed that either use of wheat straw for biogas production or multi-fuel production were the energetically most efficient processes compared to production of mono-fuel such as bioethanol when fermenting C6 sugars alone. Thus, multiple biofuels production from wheat straw can increase the efficiency for material and energy and can presumably be more economical process for biomass utilization.}

  abstract = {In merely half a century industrial processing of potatoes into consumer products has developed into a major activity in the potato world. Yearly about 30 million MT of potatoes or almost 10\% of the global potato crop are converted into consumer products, mainly in the EU and North America where one to two thirds of the daily potato consumption is in a processed form such as French fries and potato chips. In the first part of this paper the developments in potato processing are described: the global growth of the processing industry, the development of consumption and market, product diversification, and developments in potatoes supply for processing. The second part is devoted to the future challenges of global development, consumption, health and new product development, sustainability, and new cultivar development.},

  abstract = {Efforts in hybrid breeding have made this technology one of the main factors contributing to the substantial global rise in agricultural output over the last few decades. For hybrid breeding, an efficient pollination control system is necessary to avoid the unwanted self-pollination or sib-pollination of the female parental line. This review will provide a historical overview of pollination control systems and their use in hybrid crop breeding. We outline the prerequisites for commercial hybrid breeding and summarize the most important non-biological and biological technologies. Our main focus is on hybrid systems that are based on genetically engineered plants. We describe their suitability for pollination control, propagation of the male-sterile crossing partner, fertility restoration and mixed planting. Additionally, we report on the latest findings in the development of inducible sterility systems and various technologies that enable pollination control via metabolic engineering. We discuss the pros and cons of the different pollination control strategies.},

However, the effects of selection in the genome are difficult to distinguish from random processes, such as genetic drift. Often associations between selection signatures and selected variants for complex traits is assumed even though this is rarely (if ever) tested. In this paper, we use 8 breeds of domestic cattle under strong artificial selection to investigate if selection signatures are co-located in genomic regions which are likely to be under selection. Results: Our approaches to identify selection signatures (haplotype heterozygosity, integrated haplotype score and FST) identified strong and recent selection near many loci with mutations affecting simple traits under strong selection, such as coat colour. However, there was little evidence for a genome-wide association between strong selection signatures and regions affecting complex traits under selection, such as milk yield in dairy cattle. Even identifying selection signatures near some major loci was hindered by factors including allelic heterogeneity, selection for ancestral alleles and interactions with nearby selected loci. Conclusions: Selection signatures detect loci with large effects under strong selection. However, the methodology is often assumed to also detect loci affecting complex traits where the selection pressure at an individual locus is weak. We present empirical evidence to suggests little discernible 'selection signature' for complex traits in the genome of dairy cattle despite very strong and recent artificial selection. © 2014 Kemper et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

We also analysed radiation (RUET) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUET), and their relationships with the model parameters. Values of cm and RUET were highest for early-maturing genotypes. Late-maturing genotypes had largest ED and NUET. As a result, wmax was higher in late genotypes than in early genotypes. Most traits exhibited high heritability and high genetic correlations with wmax. Path analysis showed that RUET, cm and a previously quantified parameter for total canopy cover Asum, had a major influence on wmax. Sixteen QTLs were detected for all traits explaining the phenotypic variance by up to 66\%. One particular QTL on paternal linkage group V was detected for all traits with a major additive effect and maximum total phenotypic variance.

  abstract = {Today, potato is grown commercially in almost all climates of the world, except in tropical lowlands. The highest tuber yields are obtained in areas with temperate climates in North-western Europe and the North-West of the United States. In tropical and subtropical climates tuber yields are lower and less stable. To determine if this is due to the lack of adaptation of potato to the conditions prevailing in the tropics, the effect of climate on potential yield was examined. The study presented in this thesis explored the potential and attainable yields of potato. It aimed to determine and quantify the effect of climate on potential tuber dry matter production and to assess the genetic variation in the sensitivity for this climate. Potential dry matter production in potato is governed by the genetic characteristics of a cultivar and the climatic factors, radiation, temperature and daylength. Hitherto, research into the effect of temperature and daylength on the potato crop has been done in two types of studies. The tuber yield was either correlated directly with these climate factors, or separate processes in the plant were related to temperature and daylength. The general introduction demonstrates that to understand the behaviour of the crop and the variation in tuber yields, the crop and its relations with the environment must be studied as an integrated system. The subsequent chapters describe a study in which experimental data are incorporated into a simulation model. In the experiments the relations of the individual crop characteristics to temperature and daylength were obtained and the model was used to calculate the consequences of variation in daylength and temperature for tuber dry matter production. First a series of models constructed in the Netherlands was tested with weather data from a series of years in Scotland (Chapter 2). There appeared to be no difference in the ability of the models to simulate tuber dry matter production after reparameterization. It was easier to parameterize for simple models than complex models because the latter included more crop processes. To improve the model's general applicability, the key processes determining tuber dry matter production had to be identified. In all previous models, dry matter allocation was driven by a temperature-dependent development. This was an oversimplification for the purposes of this study and therefore a new relation describing dry matter allocation had to be developed. It was hypothesized that dry matter allocation is governed by a dominant tuber sink and that this dry matter allocation determines the earliness and thus the yielding ability of a potato crop. This hypothesis was confirmed in a series of experiments on early and late cultivars in the Netherlands (Chapter 3). The difference in dry matter allocation between cultivars however, was only partly explained by the differences in dry matter production. Leaf longevity also played a role in explaining earliness and yielding ability. To assess the effect of temperature, daylength and radiation on yield formation in potato, field trials were carried out in Rwanda (2 altitudes), Tunisia (Spring, Autumn and Winter) and the Netherlands. To study the interaction between environment and genotype, eight cultivars differing in earliness when grown in the Netherlands were planted. Total dry matter production and tuber yields were analysed in terms of light interception and light use efficiency. Variation in total and tuber dry matter production was mainly explained by the differences in light interception. Light interception was divided into average light intensity, length of the growing period and in maximum proportion of light intercepted. The light use efficiency was found to be inversely related to an increased radiation intensity. Variation in length of the growing season was the most important factor explaining the differences in total light interception. Shorter days at emergence and higher temperatures throughout the season resulted in a shorter growth cycle. The extent of the response differed between cultivars and was mainly explained in terms of duration of ground cover. To quantify the relation between tuber yield and the climatic factors; (temperature, daylength and radiation) the growth cycle of the potato crop was divided into three phases (Chapters 5). By relating the length of each phase to temperature, daylength and radiation, the influence of these factors on crop growth and development processes was determined. The variation in the length of all three phases contributed to the variation in the duration of the growth cycle and thus to the variation in tuber yield. Both higher temperatures and shorter daylengths hastened the development in the phase between emergence and tuber initiation, and the degree of the change depended on the cultivar. In the second phase, from start of tuber growth to end of leaf growth, temperature and daylength had similar effects but these were less than in phase 1. The last phase, from end of leaf growth to end of crop growth was shortened by high temperatures and high radiation. The shift in sink priorities between tubers and leaves in phase 1 affected phases 2 and 3, so part of the variation in these phases could be explained from the variation in phase 1. The information obtained in the experiments was combined with data from literature to obtain a complete overview of temperature and daylength reactions to the various growth and developmental processes. These relations were introduced in the simulation model developed in chapter 3. The model (LINTUL-POTATO described in Chapter 6) was used to explore different climate and temperature situations for a standard potato cultivar.},

  abstract = {Today, potato is grown commercially in almost all climates of the world, except in  tropical lowlands. The highest tuber yields are obtained in areas with temperate climates  in North-western Europe and the North-West of the United States. In tropical and  subtropical climates tuber yields are lower and less stable. To determine if this is due to  the lack of adaptation of potato to the conditions prevailing in the tropics, the effect of  climate on potential yield was examined. The study presented in this thesis explored the  potential and attainable yields of potato. It aimed to determine and quantify the effect of  climate on potential tuber dry matter production and to assess the genetic variation in the  sensitivity for this climate. Potential dry matter production in potato is governed by the  genetic characteristics of a cultivar and the climatic factors, radiation, temperature and  daylength. Hitherto, research into the effect of temperature and daylength on the potato  crop has been done in two types of studies. The tuber yield was either correlated directly  with these climate factors, or separate processes in the plant were related to temperature  and daylength.  The general introduction demonstrates that to understand the behaviour of the crop and  the variation in tuber yields, the crop and its relations with the environment must be  studied as an integrated system. The subsequent chapters describe a study in which  experimental data are incorporated into a simulation model. In the experiments the  relations of the individual crop characteristics to temperature and daylength were obtained  and the model was used to calculate the consequences of variation in daylength and  temperature for tuber dry matter production. First a series of models constructed in the  Netherlands was tested with weather data from a series of years in Scotland (Chapter 2).  There appeared to be no difference in the ability of the models to simulate tuber dry  matter production after reparameterization. It was easier to parameterize for simple  models than complex models because the latter included more crop processes.  To improve the model's general applicability, the key processes determining tuber dry  matter production had to be identified. In all previous models, dry matter allocation was  driven by a temperature-dependent development. This was an oversimplification for the  purposes of this study and therefore a new relation describing dry matter allocation had to  be developed. It was hypothesized that dry matter allocation is governed by a dominant  tuber sink and that this dry matter allocation determines the earliness and thus the yielding  ability of a potato crop. This hypothesis was confirmed in a series of experiments on early   and late cultivars in the Netherlands (Chapter 3). The difference in dry matter allocation  between cultivars however, was only partly explained by the differences in dry matter  production. Leaf longevity also played a role in explaining earliness and yielding ability.  To assess the effect of temperature, daylength and radiation on yield formation in potato,  field trials were carried out in Rwanda (2 altitudes), Tunisia (Spring, Autumn and Winter)  and the Netherlands. To study the interaction between environment and genotype, eight  cultivars differing in earliness when grown in the Netherlands were planted. Total dry  matter production and tuber yields were analysed in terms of light interception and light  use efficiency. Variation in total and tuber dry matter production was mainly explained by  the differences in light interception. Light interception was divided into average light  intensity, length of the growing period and in maximum proportion of light intercepted.  The light use efficiency was found to be inversely related to an increased radiation  intensity. Variation in length of the growing season was the most important factor  explaining the differences in total light interception. Shorter days at emergence and higher  temperatures throughout the season resulted in a shorter growth cycle. The extent of the  response differed between cultivars and was mainly explained in terms of duration of  ground cover.  To quantify the relation between tuber yield and the climatic factors; (temperature, daylength and radiation) the growth cycle of the potato crop was divided into three phases  (Chapters 5). By relating the length of each phase to temperature, daylength and radiation,  the influence of these factors on crop growth and development processes was determined.  The variation in the length of all three phases contributed to the variation in the duration  of the growth cycle and thus to the variation in tuber yield. Both higher temperatures and  shorter daylengths hastened the development in the phase between emergence and tuber  initiation, and the degree of the change depended on the cultivar. In the second phase,  from start of tuber growth to end of leaf growth, temperature and daylength had similar  effects but these were less than in phase 1. The last phase, from end of leaf growth to end  of crop growth was shortened by high temperatures and high radiation. The shift in sink  priorities between tubers and leaves in phase 1 affected phases 2 and 3, so part of the  variation in these phases could be explained from the variation in phase 1. The  information obtained in the experiments was combined with data from literature to obtain  a complete overview of temperature and daylength reactions to the various growth and  developmental processes. These relations were introduced in the simulation model  developed in chapter 3. The model (LINTUL-POTATO described in Chapter 6) was used  to explore different climate and temperature situations for a standard potato cultivar.},

  abstract = {SummaryThe superior regeneration capacity of Lycopersicon peruvianum was introduced into the cultivated tomato Lycopersicon esculentum by backcrossing hybrid material with the tomato genotype VF11. In segregating material derived from these backcrosses, the ability to regenerate shoots on root explants cultured on a zeatin-containing medium, was highly correlated with the ability to regenerate shoots on established callus cultures. The efficient shoot-regenerating root explant system permitted us to study the genetics of this trait and to locate the genes involved, using a set of morphological markers defining all 12 tomato chromosomes. Depending on the tomato genotype, mono, -di- or trigenic ratios were observed. It is concluded that a dominant L. peruvianum allele at a locus (Rg-1) near the middle of chromosome 3 determines efficient shoot regeneration on root explants in tomato in combination with dominant alleles at one or two other loci of either L. peruvianum or L. esculentum origin. The map location of the Rg-1 locus was refined further using a number of chromosome-3-specific RFLPs. The addition of new classical and RFLP linkage data to existing literature data and subsequent processing resulted in a revised and integrated map of tomato chromosome 3. From a morphological and physiological analysis of genotypes differing in Rg phenotype, it is concluded that the genetic component associated with regeneration determines the maintenance of morphogenetic competence and not the sensitivity to hormones.},

Most studies have employed either simple synthetic populations with restricted allelic variation or performed association mapping on a sample of naturally occurring haplotypes.

Here we describe one such alternative, the Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC). This approach is expected to improve the precision with which QTL can be mapped, improving the outlook for QTL cloning. Here, we present the first panel of MAGIC lines developed: a set of 527 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) descended from a heterogeneous stock of 19 intermated accessions of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These lines and the 19 founders were genotyped with 1,260 single nucleotide polymorphisms and phenotyped for development-related traits. Analytical methods were developed to fine-map quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the MAGIC lines by reconstructing the genome of each line as a mosaic of the founders. We show by simulation that QTL explaining 10\% of the phenotypic variance will be detected in most situations with an average mapping error of about 300 kb, and that if the number of lines were doubled the mapping error would be under 200 kb. We also show how the power to detect a QTL and the mapping accuracy vary, depending on QTL location. We demonstrate the utility of this new mapping population by mapping several known QTL with high precision and by finding novel QTL for germination data and bolting time.

  abstract = {Intercrossing different varieties of plants frequently produces hybrid offspring with superior vigor and increased yields, in a poorly understood phenomenon known as heterosis 1,2. One classical unproven model for heterosis is overdominance, which posits in its simplest form that improved vigor can result from a single heterozygous gene 3-8. Here we report that heterozygosity for tomato loss-of-function alleles of SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT), which is the genetic originator of the flowering hormone florigen, increases yield by up to 60\%. Yield overdominance from SFT heterozygosity is robust, occurring in distinct genetic backgrounds and environments. We show that several traits integrate pleiotropically to drive heterosis in a multiplicative manner 9 , and these effects derive from a suppression of growth termination mediated by SELF PRUNING (SP), an antagonist of SFT. Our findings provide the first example of a single overdominant gene for yield and suggest that single heterozygous mutations may improve productivity in other agricultural organisms. Elucidating why hybrid organisms show greater vigor than their inbred parents (heterosis) has intrigued biologists since Darwin first sought to explain why outcrossing is prevalent in nature 2,10. Although heterosis is used extensively in agriculture 11 , a lack of knowledge of the mechanism(s) responsible for heterosis has precluded boosting heterotic effects beyond present values. Three classical models have served as the foundation for dissecting heterosis into genetic and molecular components 1,3,12,13. The dominance model proposes that distinct sets of deleterious recessive alleles undergo genome-wide com-plementation in hybrids. Conversely, the overdominance model states that intralocus allelic interactions at one or more heterozygous genes leads to increased vigor. Genes showing overdominance are the most noteworthy and sought after from both a fundamental and applied perspective, because with overdominance theoretically only a single heterozygous gene is needed to achieve heterosis. Although many over-dominant quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified through genetic mapping experiments, further studies have revealed several examples supporting the third model, pseudo-overdominance, which is dominance that mimics overdominance because the mutations involved are linked. Consequently, there is little support for single-gene overdominance 1,14. Nevertheless, notable classical reports in non-crop plants 15 and animals 4,5 have suggested, amid controversy 6,7 , that heterozygosity for single gene mutations can cause overdominance. Working under the hypothesis that mutations have the potential to be overdominant, we searched for genes that cause heterosis in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) 16. To identify overdominant mutations for yield, we crossed 33 diverse fertile mutants with the matching non-mutagenized parent known as 'M82' to create isogenic mutant heterozygotes and compared their yields (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1 and Online Methods) 17. Six mutant heterozy-gotes showed heterosis, with the individual effects ranging from 36\% to 88\% (Supplementary Fig. 1a). From these six lines, two mutants (e0137 and e4537) showed reproducible heterosis as heterozygotes (Supplementary Fig. 1b), and, notably, these effects matched over-dominant QTL from a wild-species introgression-line population 16. The gene responsible for mutant e0137 has not yet been identified ; however, e4537, which displayed the strongest heterosis, was shown previously to carry a missense mutation in the classical gene SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT) 18 (Online Methods). SFT encodes the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS T (encoded by FT) and is the genetic originator of the flowering hormone flori-gen 19. Similar to Arabidopsis FT −/− (ft/ft) mutants, tomato plants with SFT loss-of-function alleles flower later than normal. Additionally, in tomato SFT −/− (sft/sft) plants, only a few inflorescences develop before reverting to indeterminate vegetative branches that infrequently produce single fertile flowers. Because canonical multiflowered inflo-rescences almost never form, sft/sft plants are large and produce the fewest inflorescences, flowers and fruits of all genotypes (Fig. 1). Because our initial screen focused on first-generation (F 1) hetero-zygotes, DNA changes other than the missense mutation at SFT could have caused the heterosis. We therefore confirmed that over-dominance co-segregated with heterozygosity for the sft mutant e4537 (hereafter referred to as sft-4537) (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Online Methods). However, we could not rule out the possibility that molecular changes linked to SFT were involved in heterosis. Furthermore, because sft-4537 results in only one amino acid change and is a weak allele (Online Methods) 18 , we could not determine if overdominance resulted from an intralocus allelic interaction between the functional and mutated alleles of SFT or if this was a case of mutant overdomi-nance, in which having only one normal copy of SFT drives the effect. To resolve both issues, we confirmed that two independent strong},

Hybrid breeding is slower and more resource-intensive than inbred breeding, but it allows systematic improvement of a population by recurrent selection and exploitation of heterosis simultaneously. Inbred parental lines can identically reproduce both themselves and their F1 progeny indefinitely, whereas outbred lines cannot, so uniform outbred lines must be bred indirectly through their inbred parents to harness heterosis. Heterosis is an expected consequence of whole-genome non-additive effects at the population level over evolutionary time. Understanding heterosis from the perspective of molecular genetic mechanisms alone may be elusive, because heterosis is likely an emergent property of populations. Hybrid breeding is a process of recurrent population improvement to maximize hybrid performance. Hybrid breeding is not maximization of heterosis per se, nor testing random combinations of individuals to find an exceptional hybrid, nor using heterosis in place of population improvement. Though there are methods to harness heterosis other than hybrid breeding, such as use of open-pollinated varieties or clonal propagation, they are not currently suitable for all crops or production environments. The use of genomic selection can decrease cycle time and costs in hybrid breeding, particularly by rapidly establishing heterotic pools, reducing testcrossing, and limiting the loss of genetic variance. Open questions in optimal use of genomic selection in hybrid crop breeding programs remain, such as how to choose founders of heterotic pools, the importance of dominance effects in genomic prediction, the necessary frequency of updating the training set with phenotypic information, and how to maintain genetic variance and prevent fixation of deleterious alleles.},

Hybrid breeding is not maximization of heterosis per se, nor testing random combinations of individuals to find an exceptional hybrid, nor using heterosis in place of population improvement. Though there are methods to harness heterosis other than hybrid breeding, such as use of open-pollinated varieties or clonal propagation, they are not currently suitable for all crops or production environments. The use of genomic selection can decrease cycle time and costs in hybrid breeding, particularly by rapidly establishing heterotic pools, reducing testcrossing, and limiting the loss of genetic variance. Open questions in optimal use of genomic selection in hybrid crop breeding programs remain, such as how to choose founders of heterotic pools, the importance of dominance effects in genomic prediction, the necessary frequency of updating the training set with phenotypic information, and how to maintain genetic variance and prevent fixation of deleterious alleles.},

  abstract = {Key message Reciprocal recurrent selection sometimes increases genetic gain per unit cost in clonal diploids with heterosis due to dominance, but it typically does not benefit autopolyploids. Abstract Breeding can change the dominance as well as additive genetic value of populations, thus utilizing heterosis. A common hybrid breeding strategy is reciprocal recurrent selection (RRS), in which parents of hybrids are typically recycled within pools based on general combining ability. However, the relative performances of RRS and other breeding strategies have not been thoroughly compared. RRS can have relatively increased costs and longer cycle lengths, but these are sometimes outweighed by its ability to harness heterosis due to dominance. Here, we used stochastic simulation to compare genetic gain per unit cost of RRS, terminal crossing, recurrent selection on breeding value, and recurrent selection on cross performance considering different amounts of population heterosis due to dominance, relative cycle lengths, time horizons, estimation methods, selection intensities, and ploidy levels. In diploids with phenotypic selection at high intensity, whether RRS was the optimal breeding strategy depended on the initial population heterosis. However, in diploids with rapid-cycling genomic selection at high intensity, RRS was the optimal breeding strategy after 50 years over almost all amounts of initial population heterosis under the study assumptions. Diploid RRS required more population heterosis to outperform other strategies as its relative cycle length increased and as selection intensity and time horizon decreased. The optimal strategy depended on selection intensity, a proxy for inbreeding rate. Use of diploid fully inbred parents vs. outbred parents with RRS typically did not affect genetic gain. In autopolyploids, RRS typically did not outperform one-pool strategies regardless of the initial population heterosis.},

  abstract = {Multivariate statistical methods are derived for measuring selection solely from observed changes in the distribution of phenotypic characters in a population within a generation. Selective effects are readily detectable in characters that do not change with age, such as meristic traits or adult characters in species with determinate growth. Ontogenetic characters, including allometric growth rates, can be analyzed in longitudinal studies where individuals are followed through time. Following an approach pioneered by Pearson (1903), this analysis helps to reveal the target(s) of selection, and to quantify its intensity, without identifying the selective agent(s). By accounting for indirect selection through correlated characters, separate forces of directional and stabilizing (or disruptive) selection acting directly on each character can be measured. These directional and stabilizing selection coefficients are respectively the parameters that describe the best linear and quadratic approximations to the selective surface of individual fitness as a function of the phenotypic characters. The theory is illustrated by estimating selective forces on morphological characters influencing survival in pentatomid bugs and in house sparrows during severe weather conditions.},

  abstract = {The RNA-guided Cas9 system represents a flexible approach for genome editing in plants. This method can create specific mutations that knock-out or alter target gene function. It provides a valuable tool for plant research and offers opportunities for crop improvement. We investigate the use and target specificity requirements of RNA-guided Cas9 genome editing in barley (Hordeum vulgare) and Brassica oleracea by targeting multicopy genes. In barley, we target two copies of HvPM19 and observe Cas9-induced mutations in the first generation of 23 \% and 10 \% of the lines, respectively. In B. oleracea, targeting of BolC.GA4.a leads to Cas9-induced mutations in 10 \% of first generation plants screened. In addition, a phenotypic screen identifies T0 plants with the expected dwarf phenotype associated with knock-out of the target gene. In both barley and B. oleracea stable Cas9-induced mutations are transmitted to T2 plants independently of the T-DNA construct. We observe off-target activity in both species, despite the presence of at least one mismatch between the single guide RNA and the non-target gene sequences. In barley, a transgene-free plant has concurrent mutations in the target and non-target copies of HvPM19. We demonstrate the use of RNA-guided Cas9 to generate mutations in target genes of both barley and B. oleracea and show stable transmission of these mutations thus establishing the potential for rapid characterisation of gene function in these species. In addition, the off-target effects reported offer both potential difficulties and specific opportunities to target members of multigene families in crops.},

  abstract = {Low-rank smoothing techniques have gained much popularity in non-standard regression modeling. In particular, penalized splines and tensor product smooths are used as flexible tools to study non-parametric relationships among several covariates. The use of standard statistical software facilitates their use for several types of problems and applications. However, when interaction terms are considered in the modeling, and multiple smoothing parameters need to be estimated standard software does not work well when datasets are large or higher-order interactions are included or need to be tested. In this paper, a general approach for constructing and estimating bivariate smooth models for additive and interaction terms using penalized splines is proposed. The formulation is based on the mixed model representation of the smooth-ANOVA model by Lee and Durbán (in press), and several nested models in terms of random effects components are proposed. Each component has a clear interpretation in terms of function shape and model identifiability constraints. The term PS-ANOVA is coined for this type of models. The estimation method is relatively straightforward based on the algorithm by Schall (1991) for generalized linear mixed models. Further, a simplification of the smooth interaction term is used by constructing lower-rank basis (nested basis). Finally, some simulation studies and real data examples are presented to evaluate the new model and the estimation method.},

The system was able to diagnose the presence of targeted pest-resistance markers, to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in a tetraploid population, and to track variation in a diploid segregating population. PotatoMASH efficiently surveys genetic variation throughout the potato genome, and can be implemented as a single low-cost genotyping platform that will allow the routine and simultaneous application of marker-assisted selection (MAS) and other genotyping applications in commercial potato breeding programmes.},

The mapping populations included 254 F 10 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Lemont (japonica) and Teqing (indica) and two BC and two testcross hybrid populations derived from crosses between the RILs and their parents plus two testers (Zhong 413 and IR64).

The mean performance of the BC or testcross hybrids was largely determined by their heterosis measurements. The hybrid breakdown (part of inbreeding depression) values of individual RILs were negatively associated with the heterosis measurements of their BC or testcross hybrids, indicating the partial genetic overlap of genes causing hybrid breakdown and heterosis in rice. A large number of epistatic QTL pairs and a few main-effect QTL were identified, which were responsible for 65\% of the phenotypic variation of BY and GY in each of the populations with the former explaining a much greater portion of the variation. Two conclusions concerning the loci associated with inbreeding depression and heterosis in rice were reached from our results. First, most QTL associated with inbreeding depression and heterosis in rice appeared to be involved in epistasis. Second, most (90\%) QTL contributing to heterosis appeared to be overdominant. These observations tend to implicate epistasis and overdominance, rather than dominance, as the major genetic basis of heterosis in rice.

To identify the DNA segment that codes for early maturity, a tetraploid potato segregation population of “Zhongshu 19” × “Zhongshu 3” was genetically analyzed, using a combination of high throughput simplified genome sequencing (2b-RAD) and bulked segregant analysis (BSA). The DNA segment related to the early-maturity trait was identified at the 3.7\textbackslash textasciitilde4.2 Mb locus on the short arm of chromosome 5. Eight molecular markers were developed, of which five were closely linked to the early-maturity trait loci. Additionally, 42 simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers were constructed based on the reference sequence of Solanum tuberosum group Phureja DM1-3 516 R44 (DM). Using the TetraploidMap software, the linkage map of chromosome 5 was constructed with 50 markers. The total map length was 172 centiMorgan (cM), with an average genetic distance of 3.44 cM. Correlating molecular and phenotypic data of the segregating population, the mapped Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) on the short arm of chromosome 5 contributed to 33.55\% of the early-maturity phenotype. The early-maturity QTL was located at 84 cM, flanked by the SSR5-85-1 and SCAR5-8 markers. The QTL was fine-mapped to 471 kb. Using DNA sequence annotation, 34 genes were identified in this region, 12 of them with unknown function. Among the other 22 annotated genes, E3 ubiquitin ligase gene PUB14 could be related to maturity and regulation of tuber formation. The constructed QTL map is a useful basic tool for the cloning of early-maturity related genes in tetraploid potatoes.},

To investigate the complex genetic basis of these traits in the cultivated potato, as well as the relationship between them, we developed a linkage map in a tetraploid population of 192 clones derived from the cross Longshu 8 × Zaodabai and mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for tuber starch content and plant maturity using data collected in three diverse environments over two years. We detected eleven QTL for tuber starch content distributed on seven chromosomes, of which four, on chromosomes I, II, and VIII, were expressed in at least three environments.

Because the reproducible QTL for plant maturity and tuber starch content mapped to different chromosomes and neither overlapping QTL, nor any genetic interaction between QTL were detected, we infer that tuber starch content and plant maturity are controlled by independent genetic loci.

  abstract = {The identity-by-descent (IBD)-based mixed model approach introduced in this study can detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) referring to the parental origin and simultaneously account for multilevel relatedness of individuals within and across families. This unified approach is proved to be a powerful approach for all kinds of multiparental population (MPP) designs. Multiparental populations (MPPs) have become popular for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection. Tools for QTL mapping in MPPs are mostly developed for specific MPPs and do not generalize well to other MPPs. We present an IBD-based mixed model approach for QTL mapping in all kinds of MPP designs, e.g., diallel, Nested Association Mapping (NAM), and Multiparental Advanced Generation Intercross (MAGIC) designs. The first step is to compute identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities using a general Hidden Markov model framework, called reconstructing ancestry blocks bit by bit (RABBIT). Next, functions of IBD information are used as design matrices, or genetic predictors, in a mixed model approach to estimate variance components for multiallelic genetic effects associated with parents. Family-specific residual genetic effects are added, and a polygenic effect is structured by kinship relations between individuals. Case studies of simulated diallel, NAM, and MAGIC designs proved that the advanced IBD-based multi-QTL mixed model approach incorporating both kinship relations and family-specific residual variances (IBD.MQMkin\_F) is robust across a variety of MPP designs and allele segregation patterns in comparison to a widely used benchmark association mapping method, and in most cases, outperformed or behaved at least as well as other tools developed for specific MPP designs in terms of mapping power and resolution. Successful analyses of real data cases confirmed the wide applicability of our IBD-based mixed model methodology.},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates.

Overcoming inbreeding depression using diploid self-compatible clones should enable to replace the current method of out-breeding and clonal propagation into an F 1 hybrid system with true seeds. This idea is not new, but has long been considered unrealistic. Severe inbreeding depression and self-incompatibility in diploid germplasm have hitherto blocked the development of inbred lines. Back-crossing with a homozygous progenitor with the Sli gene which inhibits gametophytic self-incompatibility gave self-compatible offspring from elite material from our diploid breeding programme.

This may have evolutionary advantages: seeds may provide better survival under extreme conditions, such as frost or drought, and can remain viable in the soil for years. When conditions are mild, tubers survive in a dormant state for a couple of months. When conditions become favourable again, their fast and strong sprouting provides a clear competitive advantage over other plants in the same ecological niche.},

  abstract = {Key message The predicted future yield potential of hybrids was competitive with lines in the near future, but on a long term the competitiveness of hybrids depends on a number of factors. Abstract The change from line to hybrid breeding in autogamous crops is a recent controversial discussion among scientists and breeders. Our objectives were to employ wheat as a model to: (1) deliver a theoretical framework for the comparison of the selection gain of hybrid versus line breeding; (2) elaborate key parameters affecting selection gain in this comparison; (3) and evaluate the potential to modify these parameters in applied breeding programs. We developed a prediction model for future yield potential in both breeding methods as the sum of the population mean and the expected selection gain. The expected selection gain was smaller in hybrid than in line breeding and depended strongly on the hybrid seed production costs and the genetic variance available in hybrid versus line breeding. Owing to heterosis, the predicted future yield potential of hybrids was competitive with lines in the near future. On a long term, however, the competitiveness of hybrid compared to line breeding is questionable and depends on a number of factors. However, market specifications and political reasons might justify the current high interest in hybrid wheat breeding.},

To address challenges associated with global food security, a hybrid potato breeding system, aimed at converting potato from a tuber-propagated tetraploid crop into a seed-propagated diploid crop through crossing inbred lines, is under development. However, given that most diploid potatoes are self-incompatible, this represents a major obstacle which needs to be addressed in order to develop inbred lines. Here, we report on a self-compatible diploid potato, RH89-039-16 (RH), which can efficiently induce a mating transition from self-incompatibility to self-compatibility, when crossed to self-incompatible lines. We identify the S-locusinhibitor (Sli) gene in RH, capable of interacting with multiple allelic variants of the pistil-specific S-ribonucleases (S-RNases). Further, Sli gene functions like a general S-RNase inhibitor, to impart SC to RH and other self-incompatible potatoes. Discovery of Sli now offers a path forward for the diploid hybrid breeding program.},

We describe the creation and validation of an eight-parent MAGIC population consisting of 1091 F 7 lines of winter-sown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Analyses based on genotypes from a 90,000-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array find the population to be well-suited as a platform for fine-mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) and gene isolation. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) show the population to be highly recombined; genetic marker diversity among the founders was 74\% of that captured in a larger set of 64 wheat varieties, and 54\% of SNPs segregating among the 64 lines also segregated among the eight founder lines. In contrast, a commonly used reference bi-parental population had only 54\% of the diversity of the 64 varieties with 27\% of SNPs segregating. We demonstrate the potential of this MAGIC resource by identifying a highly diagnostic marker for the morphological character "awn presence/absence" and independently validate it in an association-mapping panel. These analyses show this large, diverse, and highly recombined MAGIC population to be a powerful resource for the genetic dissection of target traits in wheat, and it is well-placed to efficiently exploit ongoing advances in phenomics and genomics.

  abstract = {Transgressive segregation and heterosis are the reasons that plant breeding works. Molecular explanations for both phenomena have been suggested and play a contributing role. However, it is often overlooked by molecular genetic researchers that transgressive segregation and heterosis are most simply explained by dispersion of favorable alleles. Therefore, advances in molecular biology will deliver the most impact on plant breeding when integrated with sources of heritable trait variation – and this will be best achieved within a quantitative genetics framework. An example of the power of quantitative approaches is the implementation of genomic selection, which has recently revolutionized animal breeding. Genomic selection is now being applied to both hybrid and inbred crops and is likely to be the major source of improvement in plant breeding practice over the next decade.

Furthermore, targeted integration of additional molecular data (such as gene expression, gene copy number and methylation status) into genomic prediction models may increase their performance. In this review, we discuss and contextualize a suite of established quantitative genetics themes relating to hybrid vigour, transgressive segregation and their central relevance to plant breeding, with the aim of informing crop researchers outside of the quantitative genetics discipline of their relevance and importance to crop improvement. Better understanding between molecular and quantitative disciplines will increase the potential for further improvements in plant breeding methodologies and so help underpin future food security.},

However, BayesR and other similar methods ignore prior biological knowledge and assume all genotypes are equally likely to affect the trait.

  abstract = {Among the several linkage disequilibrium measures known to capture different features of the non-independence between alleles at different loci, the most commonly used for diallelic loci is the r 2 measure. In the present study, we tackled the problem of the bias of r 2 estimate, which results from the sample structure and/or the relatedness between genotyped individuals. We derived two novel linkage disequilibrium measures for diallelic loci that are both extensions of the usual r 2 measure. The first one, rS 2, uses the population structure matrix, which consists of information about the origins of each individual and the admixture proportions of each individual genome. The second one, rV 2, includes the kinship matrix into the calculation. These two corrections can be applied together in order to correct for both biases and are defined either on phased or unphased genotypes.We proved that these novel measures are linked to the power of association tests under the mixed linear model including structure and kinship corrections. We validated them on simulated data and applied them to real data sets collected on Vitis vinifera plants. Our results clearly showed the usefulness of the two corrected r 2 measures, which actually captured true linkage disequilibrium unlike the usual r 2 measure. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

In the present study, we tackled the problem of the bias of r 2 estimate, which results from the sample structure and/or the relatedness between genotyped individuals. We derived two novel linkage disequilibrium measures for diallelic loci that are both extensions of the usual r 2 measure. The first one, rS 2, uses the population structure matrix, which consists of information about the origins of each individual and the admixture proportions of each individual genome. The second one, rV 2, includes the kinship matrix into the calculation. These two corrections can be applied together in order to correct for both biases and are defined either on phased or unphased genotypes.We proved that these novel measures are linked to the power of association tests under the mixed linear model including structure and kinship corrections. We validated them on simulated data and applied them to real data sets collected on Vitis vinifera plants. Our results clearly showed the usefulness of the two corrected r 2 measures, which actually captured true linkage disequilibrium unlike the usual r 2 measure. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

To dissect the genetic components of yield in potato, we adopted a reference-based recombination map composed of four segregating alleles from an interspecific pseudo-testcross F1 potato population (n=90). Approximately 1.5 million short nucleotide variants were utilized during map construction, resulting in unprecedented resolution for an F1 population; estimated by a median bin length of 146-kb, and 11 genes per bin. Regression models uncovered 14 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underpinning yield, average tuber weight, and tubers produced per plant in a population exhibiting a striking 332\% average mid-parent value heterosis. Nearly 80\% of yield-associated QTLs were epistatic andcontained between 0 and 44 annotated genes. We found that approximately half of epistatic QTLs overlap regions of residual heterozygosity identified in the inbred parental parent (M6). Genomic regions recalcitrant to inbreeding were associated with an increased density of genes, many of which demonstrated signatures of selection and floral tissue-specificity. Dissection of the genome-wide additive and dominance values for yield and yield components indicated a widespread prevalence of dominance contributions in this population, enriched at QTLs and regions of residual heterozygosity. Finally, the effects of short nucleotide variants and patterns of gene expression were determined for all genes underlying yield-associated QTLs, exposing several promising candidate genes for future investigation.},

In potato, the third more important crop worldwide, the effects of autopolyploidization at morphological, physiological and molecular levels have been explored and no evident phenotypic superiority of polyploid lines respect to the parental diploid lines has been found. On the other hand, the consequences of allopolyploidization have not been analysed so far in potato from a molecular point of view. In this work we study the variability induced by whole genome duplication in potato auto and allotetraploids obtained by chromosomal duplication of a S. kurtzianum genotype (autopolyploid model) and by chromosomal duplication of a diploid interspecific hybrid between S. tuberosum and S. kurtzianum (allopolyploid model). Polyploid lines in both models showed a tendency to increase the vigor in phenotypic characters compared with diploid parent they derived from. AFLP analysis showed no polymorphism between parental diploid and derived polyploids lines. However, there were DNA methylation changes between diploids and polyploids, indicating that polyploidization alters the epigenetic patterns in potato. It is possible that the superiority of the tetraploid can be explained as a heterotic response dependent on the presence of heterozygous loci and epistatic interactions inducing alterations in the gene regulation of the polyploid genomes.},

The four groups of crosses, TxT, TxA, AxT and AxA, held 2, 12, 20 and 21 populations, respectively. Eleven of the intersubspecific crosses were exact reciprocals. Thirty random clones per population were grown as second clonal generation in an incomplete block design with four replications in plots of two plants per clone in 1980, the parents included in many plots. Data were recorded on ten characters. The results showed that group TxA gave the highest tuber yield and AxT the second highest. The F-values indicated highly significant genotypic effects for all characters in all populations. The mean genotypic coefficients of variation (GCV), were the highest for group AxA for all characters. The ANOVA, based on population means showed significant mean squares for general combining abilities (GCA) and for differences of reciprocalls for all characters; the specific combining ability (SCA) mean squares were significant only for date of emergence, plant height and haulm type. Almost all GCA effects of the parents were significant positive or negative. Several populations showed also significant SCA effects. The correlations between the GCA effects and the parental values were of about the same magnitude as the heritabilities; those between the population means and the midparental values were slightly lower. Compared to the midparental values, most populations showed significant positive heterosis for date of emergence, haulm type, number of tubers and under water weight; all populations had significant negative heterosis for mean tuber weight and nearly all for plant height and general impression. All populations from groups TxT and AxA had significant negative heterosis for tuber yield and so had 13 out of the 20 populations from group AxT, while seven of the 12 from group TxA showed significant positive and four significant negative heterosis. The average heterosis for tuber yield of group TxT was −11\%, of TxA 3.4\%, of AxT−9\% and of AxA−18\%. The highest mean tuber yields were obtained from crosses with a very high yielding A-parent as female, while the heterosis was negative. Though significant differences between the 11 reciprocals occurred for all characters, consistent differences occurred only for tuber yield. Averaged over the 11 crosses the TxA populations outyielded their exact reciprocals by 10.7\%. For the highest tuber yields in A-T crosses, therefore, the tuberosum cytoplasm seems to be preferable. By contrast for a high male fertility the andigena cytoplasm is preferable.},

Analysis of variance applied to North American wheats has demonstrated that resistant and susceptible cultivars significantly differ from each other with respect to the contributions of common ancestors. The contributions of Oro (Bt4 and Bt7), Rio (Bt6), White Odessa (Bt1), and Florence (Bt3) to the resistant cultivars are significantly higher than their contributions to the susceptible ones. This demonstrates that the use of these resistance donors in wheat breeding for several decades has been effective. The contribution of PI-178383 (Bt8, Bt9, and Bt10) is considerably higher in the group of resistant cultivars bred after 1965. The mean contributions of Federation (Bt7) and Nebred (Bt4) are significantly higher in the group of resistant cultivars obtained before 1965; however, the differences in the contributions of these donors between new resistant and susceptible cultivars became nonsignificant. Among the Russian and Ukrainian cultivars, there are differences between groups of resistant and susceptible cultivars from different regions determined by the differences between the regional populations of the pathogen in racial composition. In the northern region, the contributions of the wheat grass (Agropyron glaucum) and the rye cultivar Eliseevskaya are significantly higher in the resistant cultivars; in the southern region, a local cultivar of the Odessa oblast is the prevalent resistant cultivar. In addition, cultivar Yaroslav Emmer is likely to be effective in the northern region; and foreign sources (Oro, Florence, Federation, and Triticum timopheevii), in the southern region. Very few sources of vertical resistance to common bunt are used for winter wheat breeding in Russia and Ukraine. The decrease in genetic diversity in favor of a few identical genes may cause adequate changes in the pathogen population and subsequent proliferation of the pathogen on the genetically identical substrate. A new interpretation of the resistance of line Lutescens 6028 as a source of new genes, Bt12 and Bt13, is suggested. Both genealogical and segregation analyses have shown that the genes determining the resistance of this line may be identical to those described earlier (Bt1, Bt3, Bt4, Bt6, and Bt7); and the high resistance of this line is determined by a combination of these genes.},

The 156 F1 progeny and parents of a cross (MSL603) between “Jacqueline Lee” and “MSG227-2” were genotyped using the Infinium 8303 Potato Array. Furthermore, the progeny and parents were evaluated for foliar late blight reaction to isolates of the US-8 genotype of Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary and vine maturity. Linkage analyses and QTL mapping were performed using a novel approach that incorporates allele dosage information. The resulting genetic maps contained 1972 SNP markers with an average density of 1.36 marker per cM. QTL mapping identified the major source of late blight resistance in “Jacqueline Lee.” The best SNP marker mapped \textbackslash textasciitilde0.54 Mb from a resistance hotspot on the long arm of chromosome 9. For vine maturity, the major-effect QTL was located on chromosome 5 with allelic effects from both parents. A candidate SNP marker for this trait mapped \textbackslash textasciitilde0.25 Mb from the StCDF1 gene, which is a candidate gene for the maturity trait. The identification of markers for P. infestans resistance will enable the introgression of multiple sources of resistance through marker-assisted selection. Moreover, the discovery of a QTL for late blight resistance not linked to the QTL for vine maturity provides the opportunity to use marker-assisted selection for resistance independent of the selection for vine maturity classifications.},

There is growing interest in dissecting the developmental subphases of flowering to better understand and fine-tune plant development and maximize yield. To do this, we used the wild barley nested association mapping (NAM) population HEB-25, comprising 1420 BC1S3 lines, to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling five developmental traits, plant height, and thousand grain weight. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) enabled us to locate a total of 89 QTLs that genetically regulate the seven investigated traits. Several exotic QTL alleles proved to be highly effective and potentially useful in barley breeding. For instance, thousand grain weight was increased by 4.5 g and flowering time was reduced by 9.3 days by substituting Barke elite QTL alleles for exotic QTL alleles at the denso/sdw1 and the Ppd-H1 loci, respectively. We showed that the exotic allele at the semi-dwarf locus denso/sdw1 can be used to increase grain weight since it uncouples the negative correlation between shoot elongation and the ripening phase. Our study demonstrates that nested association mapping of HEB-25 can help unravel the genetic regulation of plant development and yield formation in barley. Moreover, since we detected numerous useful exotic QTL alleles in HEB-25, we conclude that the introgression of these wild barley alleles into the elite barley gene pool may enable developmental phases to be specifically fine-tuned in order to maximize thousand grain weight and, potentially, yield in the long term.},

  abstract = {The emergence of multiparental mapping populations enabled plant geneticists to gain deeper insights into the genetic architecture of major agronomic traits and to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling the expression of these traits. Although the investigated mapping populations are similar, one open question is whether genotype data should be modelled as identical by state (IBS) or identical by descent (IBD). Whereas IBS simply makes use of raw genotype scores to distinguish alleles, IBD data are derived from parental offspring information. We report on comparing IBS and IBD by applying two multiple regression models on four traits studied in the barley nested association mapping (NAM) population HEB-25. We observed that modelling parent-specific IBD genotypes produced a lower number of significant QTLs with increased prediction abilities compared with modelling IBS genotypes. However, at lower trait heritabilities the IBS model produced higher prediction abilities. We developed a method to estimate multiallelic QTL effects in multiparental populations from simple biallelic IBS data. This method is based on cumulating IBS-derived single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effect estimates in a defined genetic region surrounding a QTL. Comparing the resulting parent-specific QTL effects with those obtained from IBD approaches revealed high accordance that could be confirmed through simulations. The method turned out to be also applicable to a barley multiparent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) population. The ‘cumulation method’ represents a universal approach to differentiate parent-specific QTL effects in multiparental populations, even if no IBD information is available. In future, the method could further benefit from the availability of much denser SNP maps.},

Review: The composition and availability of straw and chaff from small grain cereals for beef cattle in western Canada. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 86: 443–455. Small cereal grain residues are heterogeneous feeds consisting of several botanical fractions: chaff, grain, leaf blade, leaf sheath, internode and node. These parts vary in composition, digestibility, resistance to comminution, intake potential and energy availability. Large differences in the nutritional quality of straw and chaff may occur from year to year and between locations due to effects of environmental con-ditions on botanical composition and cell anatomy. Stage of maturity, harvest method and weathering will influence composition and quality of the most nutritious parts of cereal residues, the leaf and chaff. In addition, cultivars and species differ in the pro-portion, anatomy and digestibility of botanical fractions. As a result, the quality of crop residues is highly variable with an eco-nomic value that is difficult to accurately assess. Cereal straw and chaff are of low economic value as they are low in nutritive value, where nutritive value is the product of nutrient intake, digestibility, and efficiency of use. However, due to availability, cereal crop residues have the potential to be a sub-stantial feed resource for beef cows. Previous reviews have not focused on straw and chaff nutrition research relevant to use by beef cattle in western Canada. This review includes discussions on yield and nutritive value with a focus on identifying informa-tion deficiencies, including the lack of detailed production statistics for determining residue yields on a regional bases and the need for more detailed nutrient composition to update regional feed data bases for western Canada.},

  abstract = {Sugar beet is a recent crop developed solely for the extraction of the sweetener, sucrose. Breeding and improvement of Beta vulgaris for sugar has a rich historical record. Sugar beet originated from fodder beet in the 1800s, and selection increased its sugar content from 4 to 6\% then to over 18\% today. Development of vegetable beets—namely table beet and leaf beet (chard)—predates the creation of sugar beet. Each of these likely shares a common ancestor in the wild relative B. vulgaris spp. maritima. Beets of all crop types share common disease pressures. Germplasm for breeding and improvement, mostly for disease resistance, is accessible from each of the crop types and wild relatives, as there are no barriers to sexual hybridization. All cultivated types are biennial, with a basic chromosome number of 9, and most new cultivars are diploid. The majority of sugar beets are hybrids, facilitated by a complex system of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). Hybrids are typically monogerm, which reduces the labor required for thinning. Genomics and molecular markers are rapidly improving our understanding of the genetic characters controlling sugar beet phenotypes, particularly with regard to bolting. Such understanding may allow an expansion of the range of sugar beet cultivation, and may help improve yield through earlier planting. Developing beets for new uses, as an energy resource, and for bio‐based industrial feedstocks, for instance, may further expand the range of beet production for human uses.},

These studies are hampered by a high level of genetic background noise due to the numerous segregating alleles, with a maximum of eight per locus. In the present study, we aimed to increase the mapping efficiency by using progenies from diploid inbred populations in which at most two alleles segregate. Selfed progenies were generated from a cross between S. tuberosum (D2; a highly heterozygous diploid) and S. chacoense (DS; a homozygous diploid clone) containing the self-incompatibility overcoming S locus inhibitor ( Sli -gene). The Sli -gene enables self-pollination and the generation of selfed progenies. One F2 population was used to map several quality traits, such as tuber shape, flesh and skin color. Quantitative trait loci were identified for almost all traits under investigation. The identified loci partially coincided with known mapped loci and partially identified new loci. Nine F3 populations were used to validate the QTLs and monitor the overall increase in the homozygosity level.},

However, F¢ST can be calculated using any FST estimator for which the maximum value can be obtained. As all three statistics have their advantages and their drawbacks, we recommend continued use of FST in combination with either F¢ST or D.

  abstract = {Whole-genome resequencing technology has improved rapidly during recent years and is expected to improve further such that the sequencing of an entire human genome sequence for \textbackslash 1000 is within reach. Our main aim here is to use whole-genome sequence data for the prediction of genetic values of individuals for complex traits and to explore the accuracy of such predictions. This is relevant for the fields of plant and animal breeding and, in human genetics, for the prediction of an individual's risk for complex diseases. Here, population history and genomic architectures were simulated under the Wright-Fisher population and infinite-sites mutation model, and prediction of genetic value was by the genomic selection approach, where a Bayesian nonlinear model was used to predict the effects of individual SNPs. The Bayesian model assumed a priori that only few SNPs are causative, i.e., have an effect different from zero. When using whole-genome sequence data, accuracies of prediction of genetic value were .40\% increased relative to the use of dense \textbackslash 30K SNP chips. At equal high density, the inclusion of the causative mutations yielded an extra increase of accuracy of 2.5-3.7\%. Predictions of genetic value remained accurate even when the training and evaluation data were 10 generations apart. Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of SNP effects does not take full advantage of the genome sequence data, and non-linear predictions, such as the Bayesian method used here, are needed to achieve maximum accuracy. On the basis of theoretical work, the results could be extended to more realistic genome and population sizes. G ENOME resequencing technologies are currently developing at a very rapid rate, which we for simplicity call genome sequencing even though it is used on a species with a reference sequence. The current generation sequencing technology is two orders of magnitude faster and more cost effective than the technologies used for the sequencing of the human genome (Shendure and Ji 2008; TenBosch and Grody 2008). Future technologies are expected to reduce cost by another 100-fold so that sequencing an entire human genome for \$1000 is considered achievable in the near future (Mardis 2008). The question arises: How can we make best use of entire genome sequence data on many individuals? One use will be the ability to predict the genetic value of an individual for complex traits. In the fields of animal and plant breeding, this would be of great practical benefit because most important traits are complex, quantitative traits, i.e., traits that are affected by many genes and by the environment. In humans the promise of person-alized medicine relies on the ability to predict an individual's genetic risk for complex, multifactorial diseases, such as Crohn's disease (Barrett et al. 2008), and the ability to predict response to alternative treatments. The first aim of this article is to explore the accuracy of this prediction using the full genome sequence of the individual. The use of high-density SNP genotype data to predict genetic value, called genomic selection, was first proposed by Meuwissen et al. (2001). In its most sophisticated form, a Bayesian model was used to predict the effects of thousands of SNPs on the total genetic value simultaneously, where a priori it was assumed that only few SNPs were useful for predicting the trait [because they were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with mutations causing variation in the trait], while many SNPs were not useful. Even among the SNPs that were useful for prediction, it was assumed that the distribution of effects was not normal because there were occasionally SNPs in LD with quantitative trait loci (QTL) that may occasionally have very large effect. To model this, the distribution of SNP effects was assumed to follow a distribution with thicker tails than the normal distribution (e.g., the t-distribution is often used). In the case of whole-genome sequence data, the polymorphisms that are causing the genetic differences between the individuals are among those being analyzed. For the sake of simplicity we call all polymorphisms in the sequence data SNPs while recognizing that other types of poly-Supporting information is available online at},

  abstract = {Whole-genome resequencing technology has improved rapidly during recent years and is expected to improve further such that the sequencing of an entire human genome sequence for \$1000 is within reach. Our main aim here is to use whole-genome sequence data for the prediction of genetic values of individuals for complex traits and to explore the accuracy of such predictions. This is relevant for the fields of plant and animal breeding and, in human genetics, for the prediction of an individual's risk for complex diseases. Here, population history and genomic architectures were simulated under the Wright-Fisher population and infinite-sites mutation model, and prediction of genetic value was by the genomic selection approach, where a Bayesian nonlinear model was used to predict the effects of individual SNPs. The Bayesian model assumed a priori that only few SNPs are causative, i.e., have an effect different from zero. When using whole-genome sequence data, accuracies of prediction of genetic value were .40\% increased relative to the use of dense \$30K SNP chips. At equal high density, the inclusion of the causative mutations yielded an extra increase of accuracy of 2.5-3.7\%. Predictions of genetic value remained accurate even when the training and evaluation data were 10 generations apart. Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of SNP effects does not take full advantage of the genome sequence data, and non-linear predictions, such as the Bayesian method used here, are needed to achieve maximum accuracy. On the basis of theoretical work, the results could be extended to more realistic genome and population sizes. G ENOME resequencing technologies are currently developing at a very rapid rate, which we for simplicity call genome sequencing even though it is used on a species with a reference sequence. The current generation sequencing technology is two orders of magnitude faster and more cost effective than the technologies used for the sequencing of the human genome (Shendure and Ji 2008; TenBosch and Grody 2008). Future technologies are expected to reduce cost by another 100-fold so that sequencing an entire human genome for \$1000 is considered achievable in the near future (Mardis 2008). The question arises: How can we make best use of entire genome sequence data on many individuals? One use will be the ability to predict the genetic value of an individual for complex traits. In the fields of animal and plant breeding, this would be of great practical benefit because most important traits are complex, quantitative traits, i.e., traits that are affected by many genes and by the environment.

  abstract = {New genotyping technologies have made large amounts of genotypic data available for plant breeders to use in their efforts to accelerate the rate of genetic gain. Genomic selection (GS) techniques allow breeders to use genotypic data to identify and select, for example, plants predicted to exhibit drought tolerance, thereby saving expensive and limited field-testing resources relative to phenotyping all plants within a population. A major limitation of existing GS approaches is the trade-off between short-term genetic gain and long-term potential. Some approaches focus on achieving short-term genetic gain at the cost of reduced genetic diversity necessary for long-term gains. In contrast, others compromise short-term progress to preserve long-term potential without consideration of the time and resources required to achieve it. Our contribution is to define a new "look-ahead" metric for assessing selection decisions, which evaluates the probability of achieving high genetic gains by a specific time with limited resources. Moreover , we propose a heuristic algorithm to identify optimal selection decisions that maximize the look-ahead metric. Simulation results demonstrate that look-ahead selection outperforms other published selection methods. KEYWORDS},

  abstract = {New genotyping technologies have made large amounts of genotypic data available for plant breeders to use in their efforts to accelerate the rate of genetic gain. Genomic selection (GS) techniques allow breeders to use genotypic data to identify and select, for example, plants predicted to exhibit drought tolerance, thereby saving expensive and limited field-testing resources relative to phenotyping all plants within a population. A major limitation of existing GS approaches is the trade-off between short-term genetic gain and long-term potential. Some approaches focus on achieving short-term genetic gain at the cost of reduced genetic diversity necessary for long-term gains. In contrast, others compromise short-term progress to preserve long-term potential without consideration of the time and resources required to achieve it. Our contribution is to define a new "look-ahead" metric for assessing selection decisions, which evaluates the probability of achieving high genetic gains by a specific time with limited resources. Moreover , we propose a heuristic algorithm to identify optimal selection decisions that maximize the look-ahead metric. Simulation results demonstrate that look-ahead selection outperforms other published selection methods. KEYWORDS},

However, there is a lack of statistical models that can exploit the correlation between traits with mixed phenotypes in order to improve prediction accuracy in the context of genomic selection (GS). For this reason, when breeders have mixed phenotypes, they usually analyze them using univariate models, and thus are not able to exploit the correlation between traits, which many times helps improve prediction accuracy. In this paper we propose applying deep learning for analyzing multiple traits with mixed phenotype data in terms of prediction accuracy. The prediction performance of multiple-trait deep learning with mixed phenotypes (MTDLMP) models was compared to the performance of univariate deep learning (UDL) models. Both models were evaluated using predictors with and without the genotype × environment (G×E) interaction term (I and WI, respectively). The metric used for evaluating prediction accuracy was Pearson's correlation for continuous traits and the percentage of cases correctly classified (PCCC) for binary and ordinal traits. We found that a modest gain in prediction accuracy was obtained only in the continuous trait under the MTDLMP model compared to the UDL model, whereas for the other traits (1 binary and 2 ordinal) we did not find any difference between the two models. In both models we observed that the prediction performance was better for WI than for I. The MTDLMP model is a good alternative for performing simultaneous predictions of mixed phenotypes (binary, ordinal and continuous) in the context of GS.},

Likewise, it can optimize breeding strategies by reducing field trial requirements, expediting hybrid development, facilitating targeted trait improvement, and enhancing adaptability to diverse environments. Leveraging genomic information empowers breeders to make informed decisions and significantly improve the efficiency and success rate of hybrid breeding programs. In order to improve the genomic ability performance, we explored the incorporation of parental phenotypic information as covariates under a multi-trait framework. Approach 1, referred to as Pmean, directly utilized parental phenotypic information without any preprocessing. While approach 2, denoted as BV, replaced the direct use of phenotypic values of both parents with their respective breeding values. While an improvement in prediction performance was observed in both approaches, with a minimum 4.24\% reduction in the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), the direct incorporation of parental phenotypic information in the Pmean approach slightly outperformed the BV approach. We also compared these two approaches using linear and nonlinear kernels, but no relevant gain was observed. Finally, our results increase empirical evidence confirming that the integration of parental phenotypic information helps increase the prediction performance of hybrids.},

  abstract = {Evidence that genomic selection (GS) is a technology that is revolutionizing plant breeding continues to grow. However, it is very well documented that its success strongly depends on statistical models, which are used by GS to perform predictions of candidate genotypes that were not phenotyped. Because there is no universally better model for prediction and models for each type of response variable are needed (continuous, binary, ordinal, count, etc.), an active area of research aims to develop statistical models for the prediction of univariate and multivariate traits in GS. However, most of the models developed so far are for univariate and continuous (Gaussian) traits. Therefore, to overcome},

  abstract = {Background: Although pockets of bioinformatics excellence have developed in Africa, generally, large-scale genomic data analysis has been limited by the availability of expertise and infrastructure. H3ABioNet, a pan-African bioinformatics network, was established to build capacity specifically to enable H3Africa (Human Heredity and Health in Africa) researchers to analyze their data in Africa. Since the inception of the H3Africa initiative, H3ABioNet’s role has evolved in response to changing needs from the consortium and the African bioinformatics community. Objectives: H3ABioNet set out to develop core bioinformatics infrastructure and capacity for genomics research in various aspects of data collection, transfer, storage, and analysis. Methods and Results: Various resources have been developed to address genomic data management and analysis needs of H3Africa researchers and other scientific communities on the continent. NetMap was developed and used to build an accurate picture of network performance within Africa and between Africa and the rest of the world, and Globus Online has been rolled out to facilitate data transfer. A participant recruitment database was developed to monitor participant enrollment, and data is being harmonized through the use of ontologies and controlled vocabularies. The standardized metadata will be integrated to provide a search facility for H3Africa data and biospecimens. Because H3Africa projects are generating large-scale genomic data, facilities for analysis and interpretation are critical. H3ABioNet is implementing several data analysis platforms that provide a large range of bioinformatics tools or workflows, such as Galaxy, the Job Management System, and eBiokits. A set of reproducible, portable, and cloud-scalable pipelines to support the multiple H3Africa data types are also being developed and dockerized to enable execution on multiple computing infrastructures. In addition, new tools have been developed for analysis of the uniquely divergent African data and for downstream interpretation of prioritized variants. To provide support for these and other bioinformatics queries, an online bioinformatics helpdesk backed by broad consortium expertise has been established. Further support is provided by means of various modes of bioinformatics training. Conclusions: For the past 4 years, the development of infrastructure support and human capacity through H3ABioNet, have significantly contributed to the establishment of African scientific networks, data analysis facilities, and training programs. Here, we describe the infrastructure and how it has affected genomics and bioinformatics research in Africa.},

  abstract = {Background: Although pockets of bioinformatics excellence have developed in Africa, generally, large-scale genomic data analysis has been limited by the availability of expertise and infrastructure. H3ABioNet, a pan-African bioinformatics network, was established to build capacity specifically to enable H3Africa (Human Heredity and Health in Africa) researchers to analyze their data in Africa. Since the inception of the H3Africa initiative, H3ABioNet’s role has evolved in response to changing needs from the consortium and the African bioinformatics community. Objectives: H3ABioNet set out to develop core bioinformatics infrastructure and capacity for genomics research in various aspects of data collection, transfer, storage, and analysis. Methods and Results: Various resources have been developed to address genomic data management and analysis needs of H3Africa researchers and other scientific communities on the continent. NetMap was developed and used to build an accurate picture of network performance within Africa and between Africa and the rest of the world, and Globus Online has been rolled out to facilitate data transfer. A participant recruitment database was developed to monitor participant enrollment, and data is being harmonized through the use of ontologies and controlled vocabularies. The standardized metadata will be integrated to provide a search facility for H3Africa data and biospecimens. Because H3Africa projects are generating large-scale genomic data, facilities for analysis and interpretation are critical. H3ABioNet is implementing several data analysis platforms that provide a large range of bioinformatics tools or workflows, such as Galaxy, the Job Management System, and eBiokits. A set of reproducible, portable, and cloud-scalable pipelines to support the multiple H3Africa data types are also being developed and dockerized to enable execution on multiple computing infrastructures. In addition, new tools have been developed for analysis of the uniquely divergent African data and for downstream interpretation of prioritized variants. To provide support for these and other bioinformatics queries, an online bioinformatics helpdesk backed by broad consortium expertise has been established. Further support is provided by means of various modes of bioinformatics training. Conclusions: For the past 4 years, the development of infrastructure support and human capacity through H3ABioNet, have significantly contributed to the establishment of African scientific networks, data analysis facilities, and training programs. Here, we describe the infrastructure and how it has affected genomics and bioinformatics research in Africa.},

  abstract = {This book was conceived as a text combining the course of linear algebra and analytic geometry. It originated as a course of lectures delivered by N. V. Efimov at Moscow State University (mechanics and mathematics department) in 1964-1966. However, the material of these lectures has been completely reworked and substantially expanded. We have tried to bear in mind the requi­rements of other mathematical disciplines and also of mechanics and physics. We hope that all parts of the text will be useful. The only preparation required for this text can be given an a first- semester course of analytic geometry and algebra at the most ele­mentary level. All that is needed is a firm grasp of the elements of these subjects. For Chapter XII the student should be ac­quainted with projective transformations and the projective pro­perties of figures in the plane. Also, in Chapter X the reader may simplify his task by skipping Subsections 13 to 23 (Section 3) and Subsection 10 of Section 7. What is left of Chapter X can serve as a minimal algebraic basis for the theory of multidimensional in­tegration. It may be noted in conclusion that the first five chapters already contain material with broad applications in mathematics, mecha­nics, and physics. These chapters, supplemented with some of the material of subsequent chapters, can be utilized in higher tech­nical schools with a more advanced mathematics curriculum.},

@report{Ne1,
  title = {{{ESTIMATION OF AVERAGE HETEROZYGOSITY AND GENETIC DISTANCE FROM A SMALL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS}}},
  author = {Ne1, Masatoshi},
  abstract = {The magnitudes of the systematic biases involved in sample heterozygosity and sample genetic distances are evaluated, and formulae for obtaining unbiased estimates of average heterozygosity and genetic distance are developed. It is also shown that the number of individuals to be used for estimating average heterozygosity can be very small if a large number of loci are studied and the average heterozygosity is low. The number of individuals to be used for estimating genetic distance can also be very small if the genetic distance is large and the average heterozygosity of the two species compared is low. TUDYING the sampling variance of heterozygosity and genetic distance, NEI and ROYCHOUDHURY (1974) concluded that for estimating average het-erozygosity and genetic distance a large number of loci rather than a large number of individuals per locus should be used when the total number of genes to be examined is fixed. Recently, GORMAN and RENZI (unpublished) have shown that in lizards even a single individual from each species provides genetic distance estimates that are quite useful for constructing dendrograms, provided that the genetic distances between species are sufficiently large. They also confirmed NEI and ROYCHOUDHURY'S (1974) theoretical conclusion that a relatively reliable estimate of average heterozygosity can be obtained from a small number of individuals if a large number of loci are examined. In this note I shall extend NEI and ROYCHOUDHURY'S (1974) study and present a further theoretical basis for GORMAN and RENZI'S unpublished observations. I will also present statistical methods for obtaining unbiased estimates of average heterozygosity and genetic distance. The first problem I would like to discuss is the magnitude of systematic bias introduced by a small sample size when the ordinary method of estimating average heterozygosity and genetic distance is used. Let pc be the frequency of the ith allele at a locus in a population and xi be the corresponding allele frequency in a sample from the population. The population heterozygosity at this locus is = 1-\textbackslash textasciitilde p f , where 2 stands €or summation over all alleles. The average Genetics 89: 583-590 July, 1978.},

  author = {Ne1, Masatoshi},
  abstract = {The magnitudes of the systematic biases involved in sample heterozygosity and sample genetic distances are evaluated, and formulae for obtaining unbiased estimates of average heterozygosity and genetic distance are developed. It is also shown that the number of individuals to be used for estimating average heterozygosity can be very small if a large number of loci are studied and the average heterozygosity is low. The number of individuals to be used for estimating genetic distance can also be very small if the genetic distance is large and the average heterozygosity of the two species compared is low. TUDYING the sampling variance of heterozygosity and genetic distance, NEI and ROYCHOUDHURY (1974) concluded that for estimating average het-erozygosity and genetic distance a large number of loci rather than a large number of individuals per locus should be used when the total number of genes to be examined is fixed. Recently, GORMAN and RENZI (unpublished) have shown that in lizards even a single individual from each species provides genetic distance estimates that are quite useful for constructing dendrograms, provided that the genetic distances between species are sufficiently large. They also confirmed NEI and ROYCHOUDHURY'S (1974) theoretical conclusion that a relatively reliable estimate of average heterozygosity can be obtained from a small number of individuals if a large number of loci are examined. In this note I shall extend NEI and ROYCHOUDHURY'S (1974) study and present a further theoretical basis for GORMAN and RENZI'S unpublished observations. I will also present statistical methods for obtaining unbiased estimates of average heterozygosity and genetic distance. The first problem I would like to discuss is the magnitude of systematic bias introduced by a small sample size when the ordinary method of estimating average heterozygosity and genetic distance is used. Let pc be the frequency of the ith allele at a locus in a population and xi be the corresponding allele frequency in a sample from the population. The population heterozygosity at this locus is = 1-\textasciitilde{} p f , where 2 stands €or summation over all alleles. The average Genetics 89: 583-590 July, 1978.},

Bioinformatic and array analyses of gene expression profiles in developing caryopses identified the CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE F6 (CSLF6) gene as encoding a putative beta-glucan synthase. RNA interference constructs were therefore designed to down-regulate CSLF6 gene expression and expressed in transgenic wheat under the control of a starchy endosperm-specific HMW subunit gene promoter. Analysis of wholemeal flours using an enzyme-based kit and by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography after digestion with lichenase showed decreases in total beta-glucan of between 30\% and 52\% and between 36\% and 53\%, respectively, in five transgenic lines compared to three control lines. The content of water-extractable beta-glucan was also reduced by about 50\% in the transgenic lines, and the M(r) distribution of the fraction was decreased from an average of 79 to 85 x 10(4) g/mol in the controls and 36 to 57 x 10(4) g/mol in the transgenics. Immunolocalization of beta-glucan in semithin sections of mature and developing grains confirmed that the impact of the transgene was confined to the starchy endosperm with little or no effect on the aleurone or outer layers of the grain. The results confirm that the CSLF6 gene of wheat encodes a beta-glucan synthase and indicate that transgenic manipulation can be used to enhance the health benefits of wheat products.},

  abstract = {Quantitative trait loci (QTL) are most often detected through designed mapping experiments. An alternative approach is in silico mapping, whereby genes are detected using existing phenotypic and genomic databases. We explored the usefulness of in silico mapping via a mixed-model approach in maize (Zea mays L.). Specifically, our objective was to determine if the procedure gave results that were repeatable across populations. Multilocation data were obtained from the 1995-2002 hybrid testing program of Limagrain Genetics in Europe. Nine heterotic patterns comprised 22,774 single crosses. These single crosses were made from 1,266 inbreds that had data for 96 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. By a mixed-model approach, we estimated the general combining ability effects associated with marker alleles in each heterotic pattern. The numbers of marker loci with significant effects-37 for plant height, 24 for smut [Ustilago maydis (DC.) Cda.] resistance, and 44 for grain moisture-were consistent with previous results from designed mapping experiments. Each trait had many loci with small effects and few loci with large effects. For smut resistance, a marker in bin 8.05 on chromosome 8 had a significant effect in seven (out of a maximum of 18) instances. For this major QTL, the maximum effect of an allele substitution ranged from 5.4\% to 41.9\%, with an average of 22.0\%. We conclude that in silico mapping via a mixed-model approach can detect associations that are repeatable across different populations. We speculate that in silico mapping will be more useful for gene discovery than for selection in plant breeding programs.},

Cda.] resistance, and 44 for grain moisture-were consistent with previous results from designed mapping experiments. Each trait had many loci with small effects and few loci with large effects. For smut resistance, a marker in bin 8.05 on chromosome 8 had a significant effect in seven (out of a maximum of 18) instances. For this major QTL, the maximum effect of an allele substitution ranged from 5.4\% to 41.9\%, with an average of 22.0\%. We conclude that in silico mapping via a mixed-model approach can detect associations that are repeatable across different populations. We speculate that in silico mapping will be more useful for gene discovery than for selection in plant breeding programs.},

  abstract = {Improving the efficiency of selection in conventional crossbreeding is a major priority in banana (Musa spp.) breeding. Routine application of classical marker assisted selection (MAS) is lagging in banana due to limitations in MAS tools. Genomic selection (GS) based on genomic prediction models can address some limitations of classical MAS, but the use of GS in banana has not been reported to date. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of six genomic prediction models for 15 traits in a multi-ploidy training population. The population consisted of 307 banana genotypes phenotyped under low and high input field management conditions for two crop cycles. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers used to fit the models were obtained from genotyping by sequencing (GBS) data. Models that account for additive genetic effects provided better predictions with 12 out of 15 traits. The performance of BayesB model was superior to other models particularly on fruit filling and fruit bunch traits. Models that included averaged environment data were more robust in trait prediction even with a reduced number of markers. Accounting for allele dosage in SNP markers (AD-SNP) reduced predictive ability relative to traditional bi-allelic SNP (BA-SNP), but the prediction trend remained the same across traits. The high predictive values (0.47– 0.75) of fruit filling and fruit bunch traits show the potential of genomic prediction to increase selection efficiency in banana breeding.},

  abstract = {Background: Genomic selection methods require dense and widespread genotyping data, posing a particular challenge if both sexes are subject to intense selection (e.g., aquaculture species). This study focuses on alternative low-cost genomic selection methods (IBD-GS) that use selective genotyping with sparse marker panels to estimate identity-by-descent relationships through linkage analysis. Our aim was to evaluate the potential of these methods in selection programs for continuous traits measured on sibs of selection candidates in a typical aquaculture breeding population. Methods. Phenotypic and genomic data were generated by stochastic simulation, assuming low to moderate heritabilities (0.10 to 0.30) for a Gaussian trait measured on sibs of the selection candidates in a typical aquaculture breeding population that consisted of 100 families (100 training animals and 20 selection candidates per family). Low-density marker genotype data (∼ 40 markers per Morgan) were used to trace genomic identity-by-descent relationships. Genotyping was restricted to selection candidates from 30 phenotypically top-ranking families and varying fractions of their phenotypically extreme training sibs. All phenotypes were included in the genetic analyses. Classical pedigree-based and IBD-GS models were compared based on realized genetic gain over one generation of selection. Results: Genetic gain increased substantially (13 to 32\%) with IBD-GS compared to classical selection and was greatest with higher heritability. Most of the extra gain from IBD-GS was obtained already by genotyping the 5\% phenotypically most extreme sibs within the pre-selected families. Additional genotyping further increased genetic gains, but these were small when going from genotyping 20\% of the extremes to all phenotyped sibs. The success of IBD-GS with sparse and selective genotyping can be explained by the fact that within-family haplotype blocks are accurately traced even with low-marker densities and that most of the within-family variance for normally distributed traits is captured by a small proportion of the phenotypically extreme sibs. Conclusions: IBD-GS was substantially more effective than classical selection, even when based on very few markers and combined with selective genotyping of small fractions of the population. The study shows that low-cost GS programs can be successful by combining sparse and selective genotyping with pedigree and linkage information. © 2014Ødegård and Meuwissen; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background: Genomic selection (GS) is emerging as an efficient and cost-effective method for estimating breeding values using molecular markers distributed over the entire genome. In essence, it involves estimating the simultaneous effects of all genes or chromosomal segments and combining the estimates to predict the total genomic breeding value (GEBV). Accurate prediction of GEBVs is a central and recurring challenge in plant and animal breeding. The existence of a bewildering array of approaches for predicting breeding values using markers underscores the importance of identifying approaches able to efficiently and accurately predict breeding values. Here, we comparatively evaluate the predictive performance of six regularized linear regression methods– ridge regression, ridge regression BLUP, lasso, adaptive lasso, elastic net and adaptive elastic net– for predicting GEBV using dense SNP markers. Methods: We predicted GEBVs for a quantitative trait using a dataset on 3000 progenies of 20 sires and 200 dams and an accompanying genome consisting of five chromosomes with 9990 biallelic SNP-marker loci simulated for the QTL-MAS 2011 workshop. We applied all the six methods that use penalty-based (regularization) shrinkage to handle datasets with far more predictors than observations. The lasso, elastic net and their adaptive extensions further possess the desirable property that they simultaneously select relevant predictive markers and optimally estimate their effects. The regression models were trained with a subset of 2000 phenotyped and genotyped individuals and used to predict GEBVs for the remaining 1000 progenies without phenotypes. Predictive accuracy was assessed using the root mean squared error, the Pearson correlation between predicted GEBVs and (1) the true genomic value (TGV), (2) the true breeding value (TBV) and (3) the simulated phenotypic values based on fivefold cross-validation (CV). Results: The elastic net, lasso, adaptive lasso and the adaptive elastic net all had similar accuracies but outperformed ridge regression and ridge regression BLUP in terms of the Pearson correlation between predicted GEBVs and the true genomic value as well as the root mean squared error. The performance of RR-BLUP was also somewhat better than that of ridge regression. This pattern was replicated by the Pearson correlation between predicted GEBVs and the true breeding values (TBV) and the root mean squared error calculated with respect to TBV, except that accuracy was lower for all models, most especially for the adaptive elastic net. The correlation between the predicted GEBV and simulated phenotypic values based on the fivefold CV also revealed a similar pattern except that the adaptive elastic net had lower accuracy than both the ridge regression methods. Conclusions: All the six models had relatively high prediction accuracies for the simulated data set. Accuracy was higher for the lasso type methods than for ridge regression and ridge regression BLUP.},

Apart from the fact that generalized linear models are better suited in dealing with count data, a log-transformation of counts has the additional quandary in how to deal with zero observations. With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3. Simulating data from a negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcome of fitting models that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to untransformed count data. 4. We found that the transformations performed poorly, except when the dispersion was small and the mean counts were large. The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently performed well, with little bias. 5. We recommend that count data should not be analysed by log-transforming it, but instead models based on Poisson and negative binomial distributions should be used.}

The production of axillary flower by ap2-1 is also suppressed by exogenous gibberellins and by spindly (spy), a mutation that activates basal gibberellin signal transduction in hormone-independent manner. Ectopic axillary flower production and floral branching by ap1 flowers are also suppressed by spy. We conclude that gibberellins promote flower meristem identity and that the inflorescence-like traits of ap2-1 and ap1-1 flowers are due in part to SPY gene activity.},

  abstract = {Endosperm failure is considered the primary reason for the lack of success in intra-and interspecific crosses. The Endosperm Balance Number (EBN) hypothesis is a unifying concept for predicting endosperm function in intraspecific, interploidy, and interspecific crosses. In the EBN system, every species has an ‘effective ploidy’ (EBN), which must be in a 2:1 maternal to paternal ratio in the endosperm for crosses to succeed. The knowledge of EBN is very useful in the transfer of genes from exotic germplasm, and in the development of new breeding schemes in potato. The paper describes the strategies for introducing 2x(1EBN), 2x(2EBN), 4x(2EBN) and 6x(4EBN) germplasm into the cultivated 4x(4EBN) potato gene pool. A new methodology for producing 4x(4EBN) and 2x(2EBN) chromosome addition lines is also discussed. EBN has evolutionary importance in the origin of tuber-bearing Solanums. The role of the EBN in the origin of diploid and polyploid potato species, and as a barrier for hybridization and speciation of sympatric species within the same ploidy level is demonstrated. The origin of 3x and 5x cultivated tuber-bearing Solanums may also be explained using the EBN concept. EBN has been reported to exist in other plant species: alfalfa, beans, blueberries, rice, soybeans, squashes, tomato, forage legumes, grasses, ornamentals and Datura stramonium. This indicates that EBN may have broad application and could be useful for germplasm transfer and breeding in other crop species.},

  abstract = {Inbreeding depression (ID) is caused by increased homozygosity in the offspring after selfing. Although the self-compatible, highly heterozygous, tetrasomic polyploid potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) suffers from ID, some argue that the potential genetic gains from using inbred lines in a sexual propagation system of potato are too large to be ignored. The aim of this research was to assess the effects of inbreeding on potato offspring performance under a high latitude and the accuracy of the genomic prediction of breeding values (GEBVs) for further use in selection. Four inbred (S1) and two hybrid (F1) offspring and their parents (S0) were used in the experiment, with a field layout of an augmented design with the four S0 replicated in nine incomplete blocks comprising 100, four-plant plots at Umeå (63°49′30″ N 20°15′50″ E), Sweden. S0 was significantly (p {$<$} 0.01) better than both S1 and F1 offspring for tuber weight (total and according to five grading sizes), tuber shape and size uniformity, tuber eye depth and reducing sugars in the tuber flesh, while F1 was significantly (p {$<$} 0.01) better than S1 for all tuber weight and uniformity traits. Some F1 hybrid offspring (15–19\%) had better total tuber yield than the best-performing parent. The GEBV accuracy ranged from −0.3928 to 0.4436. Overall, tuber shape uniformity had the highest GEBV accuracy, while tuber weight traits exhibited the lowest accuracy. The F1 full sib’s GEBV accuracy was higher, on average, than that of S1. Genomic prediction may facilitate eliminating undesired inbred or hybrid offspring for further use in the genetic betterment of potato.},

  abstract = {Background: Tuber shape and specific gravity (dry matter) are important agronomic traits in potato processing and impact production costs, quality, and consistency of the final processed food products such as French fries and potato chips. In this study, linkage and QTL mapping were performed for these two traits to allow for the implementation of marker-assisted selection to facilitate breeding efforts in the russet market class. Two parents, Rio Grande Russet (female) and Premier Russet (male) and their 205 F1 progenies were initially phenotyped for tuber shape and specific gravity in field trials conducted in Idaho and North Carolina in 2010 and 2011, with specific gravity also being measured in Minnesota in 2011. Progenies and parents were previously genotyped using the Illumina SolCAP Infinium 8303 Potato SNP array, with ClusterCall and MAPpoly (R-packages) subsequently used for autotetraploid SNP calling and linkage mapping in this study. The 12 complete linkage groups and phenotypic data were then imported into QTLpoly, an R-package designed for polyploid QTL analyses. Results: Significant QTL for tuber shape were detected on chromosomes 4, 7, and 10, with heritability estimates ranging from 0.09 to 0.36. Significant tuber shape QTL on chromosomes 4 and 7 were specific to Idaho and North Carolina environments, respectively, whereas the QTL on chromosome 10 was significant regardless of growing environment. Single marker analyses identified alleles in the parents associated with QTL on chromosomes 4, 7, and 10 that contributed to significant differences in tuber shape among progenies. Significant QTL were also identified for specific gravity on chromosomes 1 and 5 with heritability ranging from 0.12 to 0.21 and were reflected across environments. Conclusion: Fully automated linkage mapping and QTL analysis were conducted to identify significant QTL for tuber shape and dry matter in a tetraploid mapping population representing the russet market class. The findings are important for the development of molecular markers useful to potato breeders for marker-assisted selection for the long tuber shape and acceptable dry matter required by the potato industry within this important market class.},

Data analysis was conducted from April 2021 through July 2021. Meta-analyses of RCTs investigating effects of IF in adults were included. The effect sizes of IF were recalculated using a random-effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence per association by applying the GRADE criteria (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) as high, moderate, low, and very low.A total of 11 meta-analyses comprising 130 RCTs (median [IQR] sample size, 38 [24-69] participants; median [IQR] follow-up period, 3 [2-5] months) were included describing 104 unique associations of different types of IF with obesity-related health outcomes (median [IQR] studies per association, 4 [3-5]). There were 28 statistically significant associations (27\%) that demonstrated the beneficial outcomes for body mass index, body weight, fat mass, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and blood pressure. IF was found to be associated with reduced fat-free mass. One significant association (1\%) supported by high-quality evidence was modified alternate-day fasting for 1 to 2 months, which was associated with moderate reduction in body mass index in healthy adults and adults with overweight, obesity, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease compared with regular diet. Six associations (6\%) were supported by moderate quality evidence. The remaining associations found to be significant were supported by very low (75 associations [72\%]) to low (22 associations [21\%]) quality evidence.In this umbrella review, we found beneficial associations of IF with anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes supported by moderate to high quality of evidence, which supports the role of IF, especially modified alternate-day fasting, as a weight loss approach for adults with overweight or obesity. More clinical trials with long-term follow-up are needed to investigate the effects of IF on clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events and mortality.},

  abstract = {New technologies have been developed over the last few years aiming to support breeding pipeline optimization for long-term genetic gains. However, the implementation of these new tools and their impact on any breeding program's budget are not well studied. Here, we compare multiple breeding pipeline strategies accounting for genomic selection and high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) by means of hybrid gain and cost-effectiveness. We simulated a hybrid crop breeding program through coalescent theory. We compared two strategies for parental updates and four breeding pipelines: conventional breeding pipeline; conventional breeding pipeline with HTP; conventional breeding pipeline with genomic selection; conventional breeding pipeline with genomic selection and HTP. All analyses were implemented under three different levels of genotype-by-environment interaction (G×E) and two trait heritabilities (0.3 and 0.7). Overall, the results show that scenarios with early parental selection perform better than the others. In addition, the implementation of HTP delivered the highest hybrid gain in the long-term, whereas the implementation of genomic selection seems to be more cost-effective. We suggest, considering breeding programs with complex trait inheritance and accounting for higher levels of G×E, investing in breeding pipelines accounting for genomic selection as a strategy to create and maintain long-term hybrid gain. Moreover, considering an unconstrained budget, the investment in both, genomic selection and HTP, represents the best strategy. Hence, these results provide strategies that may aid breeders in optimizing self-pollination breeding programs.},

Low abundances were found for transcripts from genes in the acyl-coA transferase BAHD family, for which a role in AX feruloylation has been postulated. The relative expression of these was much greater in whole grain compared with starchy endosperm, correlating with the levels of bound ferulate. Transcripts associated with callose (GSL), cellulose (CESA), pectin (GAUT), and glucomannan (CSLA) synthesis were also abundant in starchy endosperm, while the corresponding cell wall polysaccharides were confirmed as low abundance (glucomannan and callose) or undetectable (pectin) in these samples. Abundant transcripts from GH families associated with the hydrolysis of these polysaccharides were also present, suggesting that they may be rapidly turned over. Abundant transcripts in the GT31 family may be responsible for the addition of Gal residues to arabinogalactan peptide.}

  abstract = {One of the most widely used kernel functions in genomic-enabled prediction is the Gaussian kernel. Selection of the bandwidth parameter for kernel regression has generally been based on cross-validation. We propose a Bayesian method for estimating the bandwidth parameter h of a Gaussian kernel as the modal component of the joint posterior distribution of h and the form parameter \{\textbackslash textbackslashvarphi \textbackslash. We present a theory for the Bayesian selection of h in a Transformed Gaussian Kernel (TGK) model and its application in two plant breeding datasets (maize and wheat) that were already predicted using the kernel averaging (KA) model in the context of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS KA).

  abstract = {One of the most widely used kernel functions in genomic-enabled prediction is the Gaussian kernel. Selection of the bandwidth parameter for kernel regression has generally been based on cross-validation. We propose a Bayesian method for estimating the bandwidth parameter h of a Gaussian kernel as the modal component of the joint posterior distribution of h and the form parameter \$\$\textbackslash varphi \$\$. We present a theory for the Bayesian selection of h in a Transformed Gaussian Kernel (TGK) model and its application in two plant breeding datasets (maize and wheat) that were already predicted using the kernel averaging (KA) model in the context of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS KA). We also compared the prediction accuracy of the proposed method with a model that also uses a Gaussian kernel and estimates the bandwidth parameter using a restricted maximum likelihood method (GK REML). Results for the wheat dataset show that the predictive ability of TGK was at least as good as the predictive ability of model RKHS KA, with TGK showing a significantly smaller Predictive Mean Squared Error (PMSE) than the other two approaches.

  abstract = {Recent developments in quantitative-genetic theory have shown that natural selection can be viewed as the multivariate relationship between fitness and phenotype. This relationship can be described by a multidimensional surface depicting fitness as a function of phenotypic traits. We examine the connection between this surface and the coefficients of phenotypic selection that can be estimated by multiple regression and show how the interpretation of multivariate selection can be facilitated through the use of the method of canonical analysis. The results from this analysis can be used to visualize the surface implied by a set of selection coefficients. Such a visualization provides a compact summary of selection coefficients, can aid in the comparison of selection surfaces, and can help generate testable hypotheses as to the adaptive significance of the traits under study. Further, we discuss traditional definitions of directional, stabilizing, and disruptive selection and conclude that selection may be more usefully classified into two general modes, directional and nonlinear selection, with stabilizing and disruptive selection as special cases of nonlinear selection.},

  abstract = {Cultivated diploid potatoes (2n = 2x = 24) are self-incompatible, but can be altered to become self-compatible using the Sli gene. Previously, a diploid clone 97H32-6 was selfed up to S 3 using the Sli gene. To explore the usefulness of the Sli gene for the production of highly homozygous diploid potatoes, 2 S 4 families from the above 97H32-6 derived S 3 lines (inbred series A) and 3 S 5 families by continuous selfings from a different F 1 (= S 0) plant (inbred series B) were developed. The level of heterozygosity and the location of heterozygous loci on the genetic map were investigated using RFLP and AFLP markers. The average heterozygosity levels of the originally heterozygous loci decreased from 100\% in S 0 to 10.7\% in S 4 and 8.6\% in S 5 (inbred series A and B, respectively). The average rate of reduction in heterozygosity per generation (38.4\% and 38.5\% for inbred series A and B, respectively) was lower than the theoretically expected rate (50\%). However, none of the loci or chromosome sections was exclusively heterozygous in the advanced self-progeny. Thus, highly homozygous and seed-propagated diploid potatoes could be obtained by repeated selfing using the Sli gene. Résumé : Les pommes de terre diploïdes cultivées (2n = 2x = 24) sont autoincompatibles mais cela peut être modifié grâce au gène d'autocompatibilité Sli. Antérieurement, 1 clone diploïde, 97H32-6, a été autofécondé jusqu'en S 3 à l'aide du gène Sli. Afin d'explorer l'utilité de ce gène pour la production de pommes de terre diploïdes fortement ho-mozygotes, 2 familles S 4 dérivées des lignées S 3 mentionnées plus haut (série A de lignées autofécondées) et 3 famil-les S5 obtenues par autofécondation continue d'une plante F 1 (=S 0) différente (série B) ont été produites. Le niveau d'hétérozygotie et la position des locus hétérozygotes sur la carte génétique ont été déterminés à l'aide de marqueurs RFLP et AFLP. Les niveaux moyens d'hétérozygotie pour les locus initialement hétérozygotes sont passés de 100 \% en S 0 à 10,7 \% en S 4 et 8,6 \% en S 5 chez les séries A et B, respectivement. Les taux moyens de réduction de l'hétérozygotie à chaque génération (38,4 \% et 38,5 \% respectivement) étaient plus faibles que l'attente théorique (50 \%). Cependant, aucun des locus ou segments chromosomiques n'était exclusivement hétérozygote chez les lignées autofécondées. Ainsi, des pommes de terre largement homozygotes et reproduites via les graines ont été obtenues par autofécondation répétée à l'aide du gène Sli.

The average rate of reduction in heterozygosity per generation (38.4\% and 38.5\% for inbred series A and B, respectively) was lower than the theoretically expected rate (50\%). However, none of the loci or chromosome sections was exclusively heterozygous in the advanced self-progeny. Thus, highly homozygous and seed-propagated diploid potatoes could be obtained by repeated selfing using the Sli gene. Résumé : Les pommes de terre diploïdes cultivées (2n = 2x = 24) sont autoincompatibles mais cela peut être modifié grâce au gène d'autocompatibilité Sli. Antérieurement, 1 clone diploïde, 97H32-6, a été autofécondé jusqu'en S 3 à l'aide du gène Sli. Afin d'explorer l'utilité de ce gène pour la production de pommes de terre diploïdes fortement ho-mozygotes, 2 familles S 4 dérivées des lignées S 3 mentionnées plus haut (série A de lignées autofécondées) et 3 famil-les S5 obtenues par autofécondation continue d'une plante F 1 (=S 0) différente (série B) ont été produites. Le niveau d'hétérozygotie et la position des locus hétérozygotes sur la carte génétique ont été déterminés à l'aide de marqueurs RFLP et AFLP. Les niveaux moyens d'hétérozygotie pour les locus initialement hétérozygotes sont passés de 100 \% en S 0 à 10,7 \% en S 4 et 8,6 \% en S 5 chez les séries A et B, respectivement. Les taux moyens de réduction de l'hétérozygotie à chaque génération (38,4 \% et 38,5 \% respectivement) étaient plus faibles que l'attente théorique (50 \%). Cependant, aucun des locus ou segments chromosomiques n'était exclusivement hétérozygote chez les lignées autofécondées. Ainsi, des pommes de terre largement homozygotes et reproduites via les graines ont été obtenues par autofécondation répétée à l'aide du gène Sli. Mots clés : autofécondation, hétérozygotie, pomme de terre diploïde, gène Sli, Solanum. [Traduit par la Rédaction] Phumichai et al. 984},

  abstract = {Plant breeders and variety testing agencies routinely test candidate genotypes (crop varieties, lines, test hybrids) in multiple environments. Such multi-environment trials can be efficiently analysed by mixed models. A single-stage analysis models the entire observed data at the level of individual plots. This kind of analysis is usually considered as the gold standard. In practice, however, it is more convenient to use a two-stage approach, in which experiments are first analysed per environment, yielding adjusted means per genotype, which are then summarised across environments in the second stage. Stage-wise approaches suggested so far are approximate in that they cannot fully reproduce a single-stage analysis, except in very simple cases, because the variance–covariance matrix of adjusted means from individual environments needs to be approximated by a diagonal matrix. This paper proposes a fully efficient stage-wise method, which carries forward the full variance–covariance matrix of adjusted means from the individual environments to the analysis across the series of trials. Provided the variance components are known, this method can fully reproduce the results of a single-stage analysis. Computations are made efficient by a diagonalisation of the residual variance–covariance matrix, which necessitates a corresponding linear transformation of both the first-stage estimates (e.g. adjusted means and regression slopes for plot covariates) and the corresponding design matrices for fixed and random effects. We also exemplify the extension of the general approach to a three-stage analysis. The method is illustrated using two datasets, one real and the other simulated. The proposed approach has close connections with meta-analysis, where environments correspond to centres and genotypes to medical treatments. We therefore compare our theoretical results with recently published results from a meta-analysis.},

This metabolism is also key to the onset and progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Furthermore, AGA has also been shown to be responsive to drugs and agents used to treat BPH. Of note, certain botanical compounds have previously demonstrated efficacy against BPH. Here, we report the first example of a placebo-controlled, double-blind study undertaken in order to examine the benefit of these botanical substances in the treatment of AGA. Objectives: The goal of this study was to test botanically derived 5AR inhibitors, specifically the liposterolic extract of Serenoa repens (LSESr) and b-sitosterol, in the treatment of AGA. Subjects: Included in this study were males between the ages of 23 and 64 years of age, in good health, with mild to moderate AGA. Results: The results of this pilot study showed a highly positive response to treatment. The blinded investigative staff assessment report showed that 60\% of (6/10) study subjects dosed with the active study formulation were rated as improved at the final visit. Conclusions: This study establishes the effectiveness of naturally occurring 5AR inhibitors against AGA for the first time, and justifies the expansion to larger trials.},

In field experiments at four locations in Germany 250 doubled-haploid (DH) lines and their corresponding testcrosses with Express were evaluated for grain yield and three yield components. The heterosis ranged from 30\% for grain yield to 0.7\% for kernel weight. QTL were mapped using three different data sets, allowing the estimation of additive and dominance effects as well as digenic epistatic interactions. In total, 33 QTL were detected, of which 10 showed significant dominance effects. For grain yield, mainly complete dominance or overdominance was observed, whereas the other traits showed mainly partial dominance. A large number of epistatic interactions were detected.

  abstract = {In the past, plant breeding has undergone three major transformations and is currently transitioning to a new technological phase, Breeding 4. This phase is characterized by the development of methods for biological design of plant varieties, including transformation and gene editing techniques directed toward causal loci. The application of such technologies will require to reliably estimate the effect of loci in plant genomes by avoiding the situation where the number of loci assayed (p) surpasses the number of plant genotypes (n). Here, we discuss approaches to avoid this curse of dimensionality (n ≪ p), which will involve analyzing intermediate phenotypes such as molecular traits and component traits related to plant morphology or physiology. Because these approaches will rely on novel data types such as DNA sequences and high-throughput phe-notyping images, Breeding 4 will call for analyses that are complementary to traditional quantitative genetic studies, being based on machine learning techniques which make efficient use of sequence and image data. In this article, we will present some of these techniques and their application for prioritizing causal loci and developing improved varieties in Breeding 4. Past and current trends in plant breeding This perspective article considers technologies that have contributed to the evolution of plant breeding and focuses on innovations that will shape its future, amid a growing world population and changing climate. Since the Neolithic revolution, plant breeding has gone through distinct phases, separated by radical transformations. Within each of these major technological phases, we see a pattern that we would now call a shift from monogenic to polygenic focus. While it is tempting to believe this pattern is the product of greater understanding, it is most likely the product of how adaptation proceeds, as suggested by the Fisher-Orr geometric model (Fisher 1930; Orr 1998). A population evolving toward a new evolutionary optimum is more likely to substitute large-effect mutations in the first generations, while subsequent generations continue to fix smaller-effect mutations. Over time, it generally takes orders of magnitude more small effects to climb the population's adaptive peak (Orr 2005). So, as new evolutionary optima have been set by environmental changes (e.g., domestication, management practices, biotic or abiotic pressures) or major shifts in genetic background , plant breeders have selected better-adapted genotypes while pursuing faster genetic gains through technological innovations and scientific breakthroughs. As these discoveries marked transformations in plant breeding, different phases have built upon one another, each time expanding the set of tools available for making progress (Fig. 1). The first phase, which we refer to here as Breeding 1, accounts for the first 10,000 years of crop improvement. Early plant breeders domesticated useful species and unintentionally promoted domestication traits, such as reduced shattering in maize (Stitzer and Ross-Ibarra 2018) and grain composition in rice (Kovach et al. 2007) (Breeding 1.1). These domestication traits likely consisted of a few major genes controlling dramatic changes in crop physiology, as is suggested by genetic studies comparing maize to its ancestor teosinte (Doebley et al. 1990; Briggs et al. 2007). Early domestication phases were followed by long periods of deliberate selection for increased performance, probably},

  abstract = {In the past, plant breeding has undergone three major transformations and is currently transitioning to a new technological phase, Breeding 4. This phase is characterized by the development of methods for biological design of plant varieties, including transformation and gene editing techniques directed toward causal loci. The application of such technologies will require to reliably estimate the effect of loci in plant genomes by avoiding the situation where the number of loci assayed (p) surpasses the number of plant genotypes (n).

The major goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between heterosis and genetic distance determined with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The objectives of our research were to (i) compare the genetic diversity within and between seven tropical maize populations, (ii) test alternative hypotheses on the relationship between panmictic midparent heterosis (PMPH) and genetic distances determined with SSR markers, and (iii) evaluate the use of SSR markers for grouping of germplasm and establishing heterotic patterns in hybrid breeding of tropical maize. Published data of a diallel of seven tropical maize populations evaluated for agronomic traits in seven environments were reanalyzed to calculate PMPH in population hybrids. In addition, 48 individuals from each population were sampled and assayed with 85 SSR markers covering the entire maize genome. A total of 532 alleles in the 7 × 48 genotypes assayed were detected. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 89.8\% of the variation was found within populations and only 10.2\% between populations. The correlation between PMPH and the squared modified Roger's distance (MRD) based on SSR markers was significantly positive (P {$<$} 0.05) only for grain yield (r = 0.63). With SSR analyses, it was possible to assign Population 29 (Pop29) to the established Heterotic Group A and propose new heterotic groups (Pop25, Pop43). We conclude that SSR markers provide a powerful tool for grouping of germplasm and are a valuable complementation to field trials for identifying groups with satisfactory heterotic response.}

Indeed, many recent insights into plant biology have been gleaned from polyploid crops, including, but not limited to wheat, tobacco, sugarcane, apple, and cotton. A multitude of evolutionary processes affect polyploid genomes, including rapid and substantial genome reorganization, transgressive gene expression alterations, gene fractionation, gene conversion, genome downsizing, and sub and neofunctionalization of duplicate genes.

Bioinformatic and array analyses of gene expression profiles in developing caryopses identified the CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE F6 ( CSLF6 ) gene as encoding a putative β -glucan synthase. RNA interference constructs were therefore designed to down-regulate CSLF6 gene expression and expressed in transgenic wheat under the control of a starchy endosperm-specific HMW subunit gene promoter. Analysis of wholemeal flours using an enzyme-based kit and by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography after digestion with lichenase showed decreases in total β -glucan of between 30\% and 52\% and between 36\% and 53\%, respectively, in five transgenic lines compared to three control lines. The content of water-extractable β -glucan was also reduced by about 50\% in the transgenic lines, and the M r distribution of the fraction was decreased from an average of 79 to 85 × 104 g/mol in the controls and 36 to 57 × 104 g/mol in the transgenics. Immunolocalization of β -glucan in semithin sections of mature and developing grains confirmed that the impact of the transgene was confined to the starchy endosperm with little or no effect on the aleurone or outer layers of the grain. The results confirm that the CSLF6 gene of wheat encodes a β -glucan synthase and indicate that transgenic manipulation can be used to enhance the health benefits of wheat products.},

  abstract = {(1,3;1,4)- β -d-Glucan ( β -glucan) accounts for 20\% of the total cell walls in the starchy endosperm of wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) and is an important source of dietary fiber for human nutrition with potential health benefits. Bioinformatic and array analyses of gene expression profiles in developing caryopses identified the CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE F6 ( CSLF6 ) gene as encoding a putative β -glucan synthase. RNA interference constructs were therefore designed to down-regulate CSLF6 gene expression and expressed in transgenic wheat under the control of a starchy endosperm-specific HMW subunit gene promoter. Analysis of wholemeal flours using an enzyme-based kit and by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography after digestion with lichenase showed decreases in total β -glucan of between 30\% and 52\% and between 36\% and 53\%, respectively, in five transgenic lines compared to three control lines. The content of water-extractable β -glucan was also reduced by about 50\% in the transgenic lines, and the M r distribution of the fraction was decreased from an average of 79 to 85 × 104 g/mol in the controls and 36 to 57 × 104 g/mol in the transgenics. Immunolocalization of β -glucan in semithin sections of mature and developing grains confirmed that the impact of the transgene was confined to the starchy endosperm with little or no effect on the aleurone or outer layers of the grain. The results confirm that the CSLF6 gene of wheat encodes a β -glucan synthase and indicate that transgenic manipulation can be used to enhance the health benefits of wheat products.},

  abstract = {Crop yields are a result of interactions between genetics, environment and management (G×E×M). As in the Netherlands differences between potential yield and actual farm yields (yield gaps) are relatively small, progress in genetic potential is essential to further increase farm yields. In this paper we study the progress in yields of newly released varieties in official Dutch variety trials as a proxy for the progress in genetic yield potential, i.e., yield under absence of water and nitrogen limitation and pests and diseases. The use of yields from variety trials as a proxy for genetic yield potential is justified as these are well managed and because water is hardly limiting under Dutch climate-soil conditions. We compared the genetic yield progress of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), ware and starch potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) over the past ca. 30 years (ca. 1980-2010) with the developments in on-farm yields over the same period. GenStat 14th edition was used to perform modified joint regression analyses (mjra) and residual (or restricted) maximum likelihood (reml) analyses of yields in order to separate year (i.e., climate and/or management) effects from variety effects. Genetic progress in yield has been linear with ca. 100 and 60kgha-1year-1 (15\% moisture), respectively, for winter wheat and spring barley, 580kgha-1year-1 payment weight for starch potato, and, partly non-linear for sugar beet, i.e., 80-170kg sugarha-1year-1 depending on resistance type of the varieties. We also analyzed significant year effects (corrected for genetic progress) for most crops in the variety trials, which point at an effect of climate (environment) and/or management in addition to the genetic effect. Farm yields of winter wheat, spring barley and starch potato have increased linearly over the last decades, with ca. 90, 70 and 320kgha-1year-1 (in the same units as above). Increase in sugar yields on farms was concave (20-230kgha-1year-1) and spectacular over the last 10 years. For ware potatoes the genetic yield increase was only 20kg dry matterha-1year-1 and reliable farm statistics for dry matter yields are lacking. We conclude that for the main crops in the Netherlands genetic progress in yield potential of varieties newly released over the past three decades has been substantial and largely linear. Farm yields for these crops also continued to increase, at approximately the same rates, but could not always keep pace with the combined genetic and year effects (G×E×M) in variety trials, suggesting a widening yield gap. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model is a widely used tool for the analysis of multiple-environment trials, where the data are represented by a two-way table of G × E means.

The QTL analyses on the W-AMMI-predicted values outperformed the QTL analyses on the G × E means and on the AMMI-predicted values, and were very similar to the mixed model QTL mapping approach with regard to the number and location of the true positive QTLs detected, especially for QTLs associated with the interaction and for environments with higher error variance.

This counterintuitive observation may be probable in pathogen defence networks, because pathogens may target positions throughout resistance networks to manipulate or nullify host resistance, thereby leaving a molecular signature of host-parasite co-evolution throughout a single network. © 2011 The Authors.

  abstract = {Quantitative genetic studies that model complex, multivariate phenotypes are important for both evolutionary prediction and artificial selection. For example, changes in gene expression can provide insight into developmental and physiological mechanisms that link genotype and phenotype. However, classical analytical techniques are poorly suited to quantitative genetic studies of gene expression where the number of traits assayed per individual can reach many thousand. Here, we derive a Bayesian genetic sparse factor model for estimating the genetic covariance matrix (G-matrix) of high-dimensional traits, such as gene expression, in a mixed-effects model. The key idea of our model is that we need consider only G-matrices that are biologically plausible. An organism’s entire phenotype is the result of processes that are modular and have limited complexity. This implies that the G-matrix will be highly structured. In particular, we assume that a limited number of intermediate traits (or factors, e.g., variations in development or physiology) control the variation in the high-dimensional phenotype, and that each of these intermediate traits is sparse – affecting only a few observed traits. The advantages of this approach are twofold. First, sparse factors are interpretable and provide biological insight into mechanisms underlying the genetic architecture. Second, enforcing sparsity helps prevent sampling errors from swamping out the true signal in high-dimensional data. We demonstrate the advantages of our model on simulated data and in an analysis of a published Drosophila melanogaster gene expression data set.},

The improvements of these items can be expected to contribute significantly to give higher state averages in the future. An important cause for yield gain is that the genetic potential of the most recent hybrids takes advantage of higher plant densities to produce more grain per unit field area. Perhaps further gains can be achieved by the development and evaluation of parental materials at higher plant densities to identify greater resistance to barrenness. Stalk lodging, however, is still a major problem and must be corrected if higher plant densities are to be used. Consequently, breeders must develop materials that have better disease resistance and stalk quality before hybrids can be planted at higher plant densities to produce more grain per unit area. Recurrent selection can be used effectively to improve stalk quality in breeding populations, but caution must be used in selection to avoid yield declines.

To increase the amount of rice bran as a sink for triacylglycerol (TAG), we developed and characterized new breeding materials with giant embryos. To induce mutants, we treated fertilized egg cells of the high-yielding cultivar 'Mizuhochikara' with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). By screening M2 seeds, we isolated four giant embryo mutant lines.

  abstract = {In a hybrid maize (Zea mays L.) breeding program that utilizes genomic selection, resource allocation used in phenotypic data acquisition must be balanced between population size, number of environments, and the number of testers used for generating hybrids. Plant breeders evaluate newly developed inbred lines using multi-environment trials to account for genotype-by-environment interaction effects. The replication of hybrids across environments in these trials impacts the training data accuracy for developing genomic prediction models. This study examined the impact of resource allocation scenarios on genomic prediction accuracy using a multi-environment trial dataset generated using inbred lines crossed to multiple testers. A total of 369 Stiff Stalk double haploid lines from a synthetic mapping population were testcrossed to three non-Stiff Stalk inbred lines as testers, PHZ51, PHK76, and PHP02, and evaluated across 34 environments by the Genomes to Fields Initiative in 2020 and 2021. Resource allocation scenarios significantly impacted site-specific genomic prediction accuracy for unobserved hybrids in unobserved environments. A training set with three to five environments that had the highest quality data produced similar prediction accuracy as data from 10 random environments for both observed and unobserved hybrids, indicating that strong prediction models can be built with a limited set of environments for both grain yield and plant height. We found that resource-efficient prediction models that use data from one tester and three to five environments can effectively conduct selection of untested hybrids and in untested environments. Public research programs are often limited in testing capacity, and this study provides support for genomic selection in resource-limited breeding programs.},

  abstract = {In the two decades of continuous development of genomic selection, a great variety of models have been proposed to make predictions from the information available in dense marker panels. Besides deciding which particular model to use, practitioners also need to make many minor choices for those parameters in the model which are not typically estimated by the data (so called “hyper-parameters”). When the focus is placed on predictions, most of these decisions are made in a direction sought to optimize predictive accuracy. Here we discuss and illustrate using publicly available crop datasets the use of cross validation to make many such decisions. In particular, we emphasize the importance of paired comparisons to achieve high power in the comparison between candidate models, as well as the need to define notions of relevance in the difference between their performances. Regarding the latter, we borrow the idea of equivalence margins from clinical research and introduce new statistical tests. We conclude that most hyper-parameters can be learnt from the data by either minimizing REML or by using weakly-informative priors, with good predictive results. In particular, the default options in a popular software are generally competitive with the optimal values. With regard to the performance assessments themselves, we conclude that the paired k-fold cross validation is a generally applicable and statistically powerful methodology to assess differences in model accuracies. Coupled with the definition of equivalence margins based on expected genetic gain, it becomes a useful tool for breeders.},

In this article we use data from a Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) winter wheat population to explore Bayesian networks as a convenient and interpretable framework for the simultaneous modeling of multiple quantitative traits.

Finally, we discuss their relationship with other additive-effects models and their advantages in inference and interpretation. MAGIC populations provide an ideal setting for this kind of investigation because the very low population structure and large sample size result in predictive models with good power and limited confounding due to relatedness.},

Specifically, the asymptotic distribution of maximum likelihood estimators and likelihood ratio statistics are derived. These results generalize the work of Moran (1971), Chant (1974), and Chernoff (1954). Some of Chant’s results are shown to be incorrect. The approach used in deriving these results follows from comments made by Moran and Chant. The problem is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the problem of estimating the restricted mean of a multivariate Gaussian distribution from a sample of size 1. In this representation the Gaussian random variable corresponds to the limit of the normalized score statistic and the estimate of the mean corresponds to the limit of the normalized maximum likelihood estimator. Thus the limiting distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is the same as the distribution of the projection of the Gaussian random variable onto the region of admissible values for the mean. A variety of examples is provided for which the limiting distributions of likelihood ratio statistics are mixtures of chi-squared distributions. One example is provided with a nuisance parameter on the boundary for which the asymptotic distribution is not a mixture of chi-squared distributions. © 1976 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

Abstract Genomic selection offers new opportunities to revisit hybrid breeding by replacing extensive phenotyping of hybrid combinations by genomic predictions. A key question remains to identify the best design to calibrate genomic prediction models. We proposed to use single-cross hybrids issued from an incomplete factorial design between segregating populations and compared this strategy with a conventional approach based on topcross evaluation. Two multiparental segregating populations of lines, each specific of one heterotic group, were simulated. Hybrids considered as training sets were generated using either (1) a parental line from the opposite group as tester or (2) following an incomplete factorial design. Different specific combining ability (SCA) proportions were simulated by considering different levels of group divergence and dominance effects for the simulated QTL. For the incomplete factorial design, for a same number of hybrids, we considered different numbers of parental lines and different contributions of lines (one to four) to calibration hybrids. We evaluated for different training set sizes prediction accuracies of new hybrids and genetic gains along three generations. At a given training set size, factorial design was as efficient (considering accuracy) as tester design in additive scenarios, but significantly outperformed tester design when SCA was present. The contribution number of each parental line to the incomplete factorial design had a small impact on accuracies. Our simulations confirmed experimental results and showed that calibrating models on hybrids between two multiparental populations is a cost-efficient way to perform genomic predictions in both groups, opening prospects for revisiting reciprocal recurrent selection schemes.},

Corresponding reductions to trait variation create the need, and an opportunity, to identify and harness the genetic capacity of wild species for crop improvement. Here we analyze trait segregation in a series of wild x cultivated hybrid populations to delineate the genetic underpinnings of domestication traits. Two species of wild chickpea, C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum, were crossed with the elite, early flowering C. arietinum cultivar ICCV96029. KASP genotyping of F2 parents with an FT-linked molecular marker enabled selection of 284 F3 families with reduced phenological variation: 255 F3 families of C. arietinum x reticulatum (AR) derived from 17 diverse wild parents and 29 F3 families of C. arietinum x echinospermum (AE) from 3 wild parents. The combined 284 lineages were genotyped using a genotyping-by-sequencing strategy and phenotyped for agronomic traits. 50 QTLs in 11 traits were detected from AR and 35 QTLs in 10 traits from the combined data. Using hierarchical clustering to assign traits to six correlated groups and mixed model based multi-trait mapping, four pleiotropic loci were identified. Bayesian analysis further identified four inter-trait relationships controlling the duration of vegetative growth and seed maturation, for which the underlying pleiotropic genes were mapped. A random forest approach was used to explore the most extreme trait differences between AR and AE progenies, identifying traits most characteristic of wild species origin. Knowledge of the genomic basis of traits that segregate in wild-cultivated hybrid populations will facilitate chickpea improvement by linking genetic and phenotypic variation in a quantitative genetic framework.},

Unlike other plant species that have been analyzed so far for the extent of LD, cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), an outcrossing species, is a highly heterozygous autotetraploid. The favored genotypes of modern cultivars are maintained by vegetative propagation through tubers. As a first step in the LD analysis, we surveyed both coding and noncoding regions of 66 DNA fragments from 47 accessions for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). In the process, we combined information from the potato SNP database with experimental SNP detection. The total length of all analyzed fragments was \&gt;25 kb, and the number of screened sequence bases reached almost 1.4 million. Average nucleotide polymorphism (θ = 11.5 × 10−3) and diversity (π = 14.6 × 10−3) was high compared to the other plant species. The overall Tajima's D value (0.5) was not significant, but indicates a deficit of low-frequency alleles relative to expectation. To eliminate the possibility that an elevated D value occurs due to population subdivision, we assessed the population structure with probabilistic statistics. The analysis did not reveal any significant subdivision, indicating a relatively homogenous population structure. However, the analysis of individual fragments revealed the presence of subgroups in the fragment closely linked to the R1 resistance gene. Data pooled from all fragments show relatively fast decay of LD in the short range (r2 = 0.208 at 1 kb) but slow decay afterward (r2 = 0.137 at ∼70 kb). The estimate from our data indicates that LD in potato declines below 0.10 at a distance of ∼10 cM. We speculate that two conflicting factors play a vital role in shaping LD in potato: the outcrossing mating type and the very limited number of meiotic generations.},

There is accumulating evidence that some of these traits, such as yield, are affected by a large number of genes with small individual effects. Recently, significant efforts have been applied to the development of genomic resources to improve potato breeding, culminating in a draft genome sequence and the identification of a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The availability of these genome-wide SNPs is a prerequisite for implementing genomic selection for improvement of polygenic traits such as yield. In this review, we investigate opportunities for the application of genomic selection to potato, including novel breeding program designs. We have considered a number of factors that will influence this process, including the autotetraploid and heterozygous genetic nature of potato, the rate of decay of linkage disequilibrium, the number of required markers, the design of a reference population, and trait heritability. Based on estimates of the effective population size derived from a potato breeding program, we have calculated the expected accuracy of genomic selection for four key traits of varying heritability and propose that it will be reasonably accurate. We compared the expected genetic gain from genomic selection with the expected gain from phenotypic and pedigree selection, and found that genetic gain can be substantially improved by using genomic selection.},

In the case of a neutral polymorphism, average heterozygosity will be reduced to an extent which varies with distance from the substituted locus. The aggregate effect of substitution on neutral polymorphism is estimated; in populations of total size 10 6 or more (and perhaps of 10 4 or more), this effect will be more important than that of random fixation. This may explain why the extent of polymorphism in natural populations does not vary as much as one would expect from a consideration of the equilibrium between mutation and random fixation in populations of different sizes. For a selectively maintained polymorphism at a linked locus, this process will only be important in the long run if it leads to complete fixation. If the selective coefficients at the linked locus are small compared to those at the substituted locus, it is shown that the probability of complete fixation at the linked locus is approximately exp (− Nc), where c is the recombinant fraction and N the population size. It follows that in a large population a selective substitution can occur in a cistron without eliminating a selectively maintained polymorphism in the same cistron. © 1974, Cambridge University Press.

  abstract = {Abstract             An advanced and widely used method of analysis for multi-environment trial data involves a linear mixed model with factor analytic (FA) variance structures for the variety by environment effects. This model can accommodate unbalanced data, that is, not all varieties in all environments, it allows the use of pedigree information and appropriate accommodation of individual trial experimental designs, and most importantly the FA structure for the variety by environment effects is parsimonious and regularly results in a good fit to the data. The model provides accurate predictions of the variety effects for every environment in the data-set but this constitutes a large and unwieldly amount of information to process for the purpose of variety selection. We address this issue in the current paper by proposing factor analytic selection tools to summarise the predictions in a concise yet informative manner. The tools, which are natural derivatives of the FA structure, result in measures of overall performance and stability across the environments in the data-set. All measures are expressed on the same scale as the trait under consideration and can easily be combined to form an index for selection.},

  abstract = {Using genomic information to predict phenotypes can improve the accuracy of estimated breeding values and can potentially increase genetic gain over conventional breeding. In this study, we investigated the prediction accuracies achieved by best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) for nine potato phenotypic traits using three types of relationship matrices pedigree ABLUP, genomic GBLUP, and a hybrid matrix (H) combining pedigree and genomic information (HBLUP). Deep pedigree information was available for {$>$}3000 different potato breeding clones evaluated over four years. Genomic relationships were estimated from {$>$}180,000 informative SNPs generated using a genotyping-by-sequencing transcriptome (GBS-t) protocol for 168 cultivars, many of which were parents of clones. Two validation scenarios were implemented, namely “Genotyped Cultivars Validation” (a subset of genotyped lines as validation set) and “Non-genotyped 2009 Progenies Validation”. Most of the traits showed moderate to high narrow sense heritabilities (range 0.22–0.72). In the Genotyped Cultivars Validation, HBLUP outperformed ABLUP on prediction accuracies for all traits except early blight, and outperformed GBLUP for most of the traits except tuber shape, tuber eye depth and boil after-cooking darkening. This is evidence that the in-depth relationship within the H matrix could potentially result in better prediction accuracy in comparison to using A or G matrix individually. The prediction accuracies of the Non-genotyped 2009 Progenies Validation were comparable between ABLUP and HBLUP, varying from 0.17–0.70 and 0.18–0.69, respectively. Better prediction accuracy and less bias in prediction using HBLUP is of practical utility to breeders as all breeding material is ranked on the same scale leading to improved selection decisions. In addition, our approach provides an economical alternative to utilize historic breeding data with current genotyped individuals in implementing genomic selection.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of cultivars using multi-environment trials (MET) is an important step in plant breeding programs. One of the objectives of these evaluations is to understand the genotype by environment interaction (GEI). A method of determining the effect of GEI on the performance of cultivars is based on studies of adaptability and stability. Initial studies were based on linear regression; however, these methodologies have limitations, mainly in trials with genetic or statistical unbalanced, heterogeneity of residual variances, and genetic covariance. An alternative would be the use of random regression models (RRM), in which the behavior of the genotypes is characterized as a reaction norm using longitudinal data or repeated measurements and information regarding a covariance function. The objective of this work was the application of RRM in the study of the behavior of common bean cultivars using a MET, based on Legendre polynomials and genotype-ideotype distances. We used a set of 13 trials, which were classified as unfavorable or favorable environments. The results revealed that RRM enables the prediction of the genotypic values of cultivars in environments where they were not evaluated with high accuracy values, thereby circumventing the unbalanced of the experiments. From these values, it was possible to measure the genotypic adaptability according to ideotypes, according to their reaction norms. In addition, the stability of the cultivars can be interpreted as variation in the behavior of the ideotype. The use of ideotypes based on real data allowed a better comparison of the performance of cultivars across environments. The use of RRM in plant breeding is a good alternative to understand the behavior of cultivars in a MET, especially when we want to quantify the adaptability and stability of genotypes.},

  abstract = {General parameters of selection, such as the frequency and strength of positive selection in natural populations or the role of introgression, are still insufficiently understood. The house mouse (Mus musculus) is a particularly well-suited model system to approach such questions, since it has a defined history of splits into subspecies and populations and since extensive genome information is available. We have used high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing arrays to assess genomic patterns of positive selection and introgression of alleles in two natural populations of each of the subspecies M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus. Applying different statistical procedures, we find a large number of regions subject to apparent selective sweeps, indicating frequent positive selection on rare alleles or novel mutations. Genes in the regions include well-studied imprinted loci (e.g. Plagl1/Zac1), homologues of human genes involved in adaptations (e.g. alpha-amylase genes) or in genetic diseases (e.g. Huntingtin and Parkin). Haplotype matching between the two subspecies reveals a large number of haplotypes that show patterns of introgression from specific populations of the respective other subspecies, with at least 10\% of the genome being affected by partial or full introgression. Using neutral simulations for comparison, we find that the size and the fraction of introgressed haplotypes are not compatible with a pure migration or incomplete lineage sorting model. Hence, it appears that introgressed haplotypes can rise in frequency due to positive selection and thus can contribute to the adaptive genomic landscape of natural populations. Our data support the notion that natural genomes are subject to complex adaptive processes, including the introgression of haplotypes from other differentiated populations or species at a larger scale than previously assumed for animals. This implies that some of the admixture found in inbred strains of mice may also have a natural origin. © 2012 Staubach et al.},

  abstract = {General parameters of selection, such as the frequency and strength of positive selection in natural populations or the role of introgression, are still insufficiently understood. The house mouse (Mus musculus) is a particularly well-suited model system to approach such questions, since it has a defined history of splits into subspecies and populations and since extensive genome information is available. We have used high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing arrays to assess genomic patterns of positive selection and introgression of alleles in two natural populations of each of the subspecies M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus. Applying different statistical procedures, we find a large number of regions subject to apparent selective sweeps, indicating frequent positive selection on rare alleles or novel mutations. Genes in the regions include well-studied imprinted loci (e.g. Plagl1/Zac1), homologues of human genes involved in adaptations (e.g. alpha-amylase genes) or in genetic diseases (e.g. Huntingtin and Parkin). Haplotype matching between the two subspecies reveals a large number of haplotypes that show patterns of introgression from specific populations of the respective other subspecies, with at least 10\% of the genome being affected by partial or full introgression. Using neutral simulations for comparison, we find that the size and the fraction of introgressed haplotypes are not compatible with a pure migration or incomplete lineage sorting model. Hence, it appears that introgressed haplotypes can rise in frequency due to positive selection and thus can contribute to the adaptive genomic landscape of natural populations. Our data support the notion that natural genomes are subject to complex adaptive processes, including the introgression of haplotypes from other differentiated populations or species at a larger scale than previously assumed for animals. This implies that some of the admixture found in inbred strains of mice may also have a natural origin. © 2012 Staubach et al.},

  abstract = {Predicting the responses to natural selection is one of the key goals of evolutionary biology. Two of the challenges in fulfilling this goal have been the realization that many estimates of natural selection might be highly biased by environmentally induced covariances between traits and fitness, and that many estimated responses to selection do not incorporate or report uncertainty in the estimates. Here we describe the application of a framework that blends the merits of the Robertson–Price Identity approach and the multivariate breeder's equation to address these challenges. The approach allows genetic covariance matrices, selection differentials, selection gradients, and responses to selection to be estimated without environmentally induced bias, direct and indirect selection and responses to selection to be distinguished, and if implemented in a Bayesian-MCMC framework, statistically robust estimates of uncertainty on all of these parameters to be made. We illustrate our approach with a worked example of previously published data. More generally, we suggest that applying both the Robertson–Price Identity and the multivariate breeder's equation will facilitate hypothesis testing about natural selection, genetic constraints, and evolutionary responses.},

There are various methods for estimating optimum plot size and various statistics used to measure precision. Selective precision has been cited recently as being an adequate measurement for evaluating experimental precision. The aim of this study is to propose a modification in the way the optimum plot size is estimated, related to the variability of the experimental area and prefixed selective precision. The method was applied to a set of six trials with potatoes. The optimum plot size, which was estimated on the basis of the relation between the variation coefficients and different plot sizes, can be estimated by considering simultaneously and in a prefixed way, the number of replications and the selective precision related to the treatments that are being evaluated. The optimum plot size for potato varies between four and thirteen hills, depending on the number of repetitions and the selective precision that will be used.},

Resulting data, averaged over all lots, are presented graphically, and third-order and fourth-order polynominal equations are given that describe the kernel-density and bulk-density dependence on moisture content. The grain density-moisture relationships shown are consistent with relationships reported previously for narrower moisture ranges and different grain lots.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$} ABSTRACT BULK densities and kernel densities of seven lots of hard red winter wheat and 21 lots of shelled, yellow-dent field corn were measured over moisture-content ranges of 3 to 24 percent and 10 to 35 percent, respective-ly. Resulting data, averaged over all lots, are presented graphically, and third-order and fourth-order polynominal equations are given that describe the kernel-density and bulk-density dependence on moisture content. The grain density-moisture relationships shown are consistent with relationships reported previously for narrower moisture ranges and different grain lots. The kernel density and bulk density of both wheat and corn were linearly and highly correlated, except for corn of moisture contents above 30 percent. Linear relationships were observed between corn kernel weight and moisture content, as expected, and between kernel volume and moisture content. Data presented are useful for predict-ing kernel volume fractions and porosity, as well as test weights and kernel densities at different grain moisture contents. {$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}/abstract{$>$}},

  abstract = {Potatoes were first brought to Europe in the sixteenth century1,2. Two hundred\,years later, one of the species had become one of the most important food sources across the entire continent and, later, even the entire world3. However, its highly heterozygous, autotetraploid genome has complicated its improvement since then4–7. Here we present the pan-genome of European potatoes generated from phased genome assemblies of ten historical potato cultivars, which includes approximately 85\% of all haplotypes segregating in Europe. Sequence diversity between the haplotypes was extremely high (for example, 20× higher than in humans), owing to numerous introgressions from wild potato species. By contrast, haplotype diversity was very low, in agreement with the population bottlenecks caused by domestication and transition to Europe. To illustrate a practical application of the pan-genome, we converted it into a haplotype graph and used it to generate phased, megabase-scale pseudo-genome assemblies of commercial potatoes (including the famous French fries potato ‘Russet Burbank’) using cost-efficient short reads only. In summary, we present a nearly~complete pan-genome of autotetraploid European potato, we describe extraordinarily high sequence diversity in a domesticated crop, and we outline how this resource might be used to accelerate genomics-assisted breeding and research.},

  abstract = {Genetic networks that determine rates of organ initiation and organ size are key regulators of plant architecture. Whereas several genes that influence the timing of lateral organ initiation have been identified, the regulatory pathways in which these genes operate are poorly understood. Here, we identify a class of genes implicated in regulation of the lateral organ initiation rate. Loss-of-function mutations in the MATE transporter encoded by maize (Zea mays) Big embryo 1 (Bige1) cause accelerated leaf and root initiation as well as enlargement of the embryo scutellum. BIGE1 is localized to trans-Golgi, indicating a possible role in secretion of a signaling molecule. Interestingly, phenotypes of bige1 bear striking similarity to cyp78a mutants identified in diverse plant species. We show that a CYP78A gene is upregulated in bige1 mutant embryos, suggesting a role for BIGE1 in feedback regulation of a CYP78A pathway. We demonstrate that accelerated leaf formation and early flowering phenotypes conditioned by mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana BIGE1 orthologs are complemented by maize Bige1, showing that the BIGE1 transporter has a conserved function in regulation of lateral organ initiation in plants.

Cross-validated prediction correlations of 0.75–0.83 and 0.39–0.79 were obtained for dry matter content and chipping quality, respectively, when combining the three populations.

An experiment was conducted to study causes of low ileal starch digestibilities when broiler chickens were fed on wheat-based diets. Each of 5 cold-pelleted diets containing 771 g/kg DM wheat and one cold-pelleted diet containing 694 g/kg DM wheat were fed to 24 male broiler chickens in 8 cages from 10 to 21 d of age. 2. Feed intake and weight gain were significantly reduced when the wheat diet was crushed and fed in a mash form. 3. Ileal starch digestibility increased significantly from 0·79 to 0·95, 0·93 and 0·91, respectively, when the diet was crushed and fed in a mash form, was diluted with cellulose prior to pelleting, or when parts of the wheat were fed as whole grains. Correspondingly, random variation between individual birds was reduced. 4. These results indicate that an overload of wheat starch in the digestive tract may be the cause of poor digestibility for some broilers in a flock.

  abstract = {Seven quantitative traits of the cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) were studied in a partial diallel cross experiment. Large specific combining ability effects were observed for total and marketable yields, total number of tubers, and number of marketable tubers. Large general combining ability effects were obtained for average weight per tuber, average weight per marketable tuber, and specific gravity. The SCA effect for specific gravity was also significant. It is suggested that the difference of combining ability performance noted above for the two yield components was due to a long history of directional selection for high yield and stabilizing selection for tubers within the marketable size range. There were low frequencies of both GCA and SCA effects showing significant difference from the population mean. This is interpreted as an affirmation of the narrow genetic base which exists in the present gene pool in Solanum tuberosum. Heritability estimates based on GCA effects indicated that parents can be efficiently selected for average tuber weight and specific gravity.},

The linear response parameter α showed close association with v 3 which measured the genotypic response to the environmental component (r 3 ) supporting Z. The estimates of v 3 showed a moderately positive correlation with the mean marketable yield (W) and were larger than those of v 1 and v 2 for most genotypes.

  abstract = {The major cultivated species of the potato, Solanum tuberosum L. ssp. tuberosum is an autotetraploid (2n=4x=48). Other cultivated species often used in genetics and breeding are: the tetraploid species andigena (S. tuberosum L. spp. andigena Hawkes), the diploid species (2n=2x=24) stenotomum (S. stemotomum Juz. Et Buk.) and phureja (S. phureja Juz. Et Buk.). Chacoense (S. chacoense Bitt.), a wild diploid species, is often used in genetic studies and anther culture. There are a large number of wild species with ploidy levels ranging from diploid to hexaploid (2n=6x=72). Of the 176 species surveyed by chromosome counts, 73\% are diploid, 15\% are tetraploid, and 6\% are hexaploid. The rest are hybrid species that are triploid or pentaploid. Several major gene banks maintain the world collections of potato species and varieteis. The German-Netherlands Potato Genebank in Braunschweig, Germany, and the USA Inter-regional Potato Introduction Project have published up-to-date inventories. Systematic evaluation of germplasm collections are carried out by the International Potato Center, the German-Netherlands Potato Genebank, and the USA Inter-regional Potato Introduction Project. The tetraploid varieties can be used to produce dihaploid progenies (2n=2x=24). Dihaploids provide many advantages for genetic analysis and breeding work. They are used to mate with cultivated or wild diploid species. The diploid hybrid progenies are screened for superior performance of agronomic traits and, more importantly, for their ability to produce unreduced 2n gametes. The 2n gametes are formed due to the failure of either the first or the second division during meiosis. The first division restitution (FDR) and second division restitution (SDR) gametes have fundamentally different consequences on genetic segregation. The FDR gametes are capable of maintaining about 80\% of the heterozygosity of a parent and thus are beneficial in maintaining heterosis in the progenies when it is used to cross with other tetraploid parents. Hybrid progenies from 4x x 2x matings are now produced in many breeding programs. Monohaploids (2n=x=12) of potato can also be obtained from the tetraploid varieteies. Two successive cycles of chromosome number reductions are involved. A tetraploid is reduced to a dihaploid. The dihaploid is further reduced to a monohaploid. Monohaploids are also obtained from diploid species and interspecific hybrids. Monohaploids are useful tools for critical genetic analysis of the diploid S. tuberosum species (Jacobsen and Ramanna, 1994). Monoploids provide the cytological evidence of the basic chromosome number (x=12) of the potato genome. Monohaploid progenies are used to screen out undesirable and lethal genes and identify beneficial mutants. Doubling chromosomes of monohaploids lead to the production homozygous diploids and tetraploids. The hemizygous condition of monohaploids also facilitate mapping of molecular markers due to the simple (1:1) segregation ratio. Both di- and monohaploids can be produced by two methods: parthenogenesis and androgenesis. Production of dihaploids by parthenogenesis is a well established procedure and used in potato breeding to generate parents for 4x x 2x crosses. Anther or microspare culture appears to be the preferred procedure to obtain a large number of monohaploids because the number of microspores far exceeds the number of ovules in an ovary (Jacobsen and Ramanna, 1994).},

  abstract = {The aim of plant breeding trials is often to identify crop variety that are well adapt to target environments. These varieties are identified through genomic prediction from the analysis of multi-environmental field trial (MET) using linear mixed models. The occurrence of outliers in MET is common and known to adversely impact the accuracy of genomic prediction yet the detection of outliers are often neglected. A number of reasons stand for this—first, complex data such as a MET give rise to distinct levels of residuals (eg, at a trial level or individual observation level). This complexity offers additional challenges for an outlier detection method. Second, many linear mixed model software packages that cater for complex variance structures needed in the analysis of MET are not well streamlined for diagnostics by practitioners. We demonstrate outlier detection methods that are simple to implement in any linear mixed model software packages and computationally fast. Although these methods are not optimal methods in outlier detection, they offer practical value for ease of application in the analysis pipeline of regularly collected data. These are demonstrated using simulation based on two real bread wheat yield METs. In particular, models that consider analysis of yield trials either independently or jointly (thus borrowing strength across trials) are considered. Case studies are presented to highlight benefit of joint analysis for outlier detection.},

These varieties are identified through genomic prediction from the analysis of multi-environmental field trial (MET) using linear mixed models. The occurrence of outliers in MET is common and known to adversely impact the accuracy of genomic prediction yet the detection of outliers are often neglected. A number of reasons stand for this—first, complex data such as a MET give rise to distinct levels of residuals (eg, at a trial level or individual observation level). This complexity offers additional challenges for an outlier detection method. Second, many linear mixed model software packages that cater for complex variance structures needed in the analysis of MET are not well streamlined for diagnostics by practitioners. We demonstrate outlier detection methods that are simple to implement in any linear mixed model software packages and computationally fast. Although these methods are not optimal methods in outlier detection, they offer practical value for ease of application in the analysis pipeline of regularly collected data. These are demonstrated using simulation based on two real bread wheat yield METs. In particular, models that consider analysis of yield trials either independently or jointly (thus borrowing strength across trials) are considered. Case studies are presented to highlight benefit of joint analysis for outlier detection.},

Advances in diploid hybrid breeding based on true seeds have the potential to revolutionize future potato breeding and production1–4. So far, relatively few studies have examined the genome evolution and diversity of wild and cultivated landrace potatoes, which limits the application of their diversity in potato breeding. Here we assemble 44 high-quality diploid potato genomes from 24 wild and 20 cultivated accessions that are representative of Solanum section Petota, the tuber-bearing clade, as well as 2 genomes from the neighbouring section, Etuberosum. Extensive discordance of phylogenomic relationships suggests the complexity of potato evolution.

We discover a transcription factor that determines tuber identity and interacts with the mobile tuberization inductive signal SP6A. We also identify 561,433 high-confidence structural variants and construct a map of large inversions, which provides insights for improving inbred lines and precluding potential linkage drag, as exemplified by a 5.8-Mb inversion that is associated with carotenoid content in tubers.

The results were as follows: (1) higher neutral detergent fibre and lignin contents but lower crude protein and neutral detergent soluble contents were noted for the whole wheat straw plant during maturation; (2) the feed nutritive value of leaf blades (LB) is highest, then leaf sheath, and that of the stem (S) the lowest; however, as the stem constitutes more than 50\% of the whole plant, the nutritive value of wheat straw is dependent on the nutritive quality of the stem; (3) from top to bottom of the plant, the nutritive value of wheat straw is from high to low; (4) the height of the plant and proportion of stem to whole plant are correlated negatively with the dry matter disappearance (DMD), but the thousand grain weight and the ratio leaf blade to leaf stem are correlated positively with DMD. It is possible, therefore, to predict the nutritive value of wheat straw on the basis of its agronomic, morphological and chemical features and their relationship with the DMD value.},

  abstract = {Five clones of Solanum tuberosum L. Group Tuberosum (T) and five long-day adapted clones of Group Andigena (A) were crossed to produce four populations (TT, AA, TA and AT) in such a way that there was selling in the intra-Group crosses. The populations were grown for 2 years as spaced plants in a randomized, complete-block design and compared for plant vigor, maturity, tuber number, mean tuber weight, and total yield to evaluate the potential of the inter-Group hybrid (TA and AT) populations in broadening the genetic base of potato cultivar development. In four comparisons, the TA and AT populations outyielded the TT population by 8.6 to 32.9\%. Also, the TA and AT populations generally had larger variance estimates for total yield. It is concluded from the analysis of population means for tuber number, mean tuber weight, and total yield that in the TA and AT populations the heterosis for total yield results largely from the multiplicative interaction of the two yield components. The TA and AT populations showed no consistent reciprocal differences. The TA and AT populations showed greater stability than the TT population. These results have important implications for potato breeding.},

Existing WGP methods have been shown to deliver accurate predictions in the most common settings, such as prediction of across environment performance for traits with additive gene effects. However, prediction of traits with non-additive gene effects and prediction of genotype by environment interaction (G×E), continues to be challenging. Previous attempts to increase prediction accuracy for these particularly difficult tasks employed prediction methods that are purely statistical in nature. Augmenting the statistical methods with biological knowledge has been largely overlooked thus far. Crop growth models (CGMs) attempt to represent the impact of functional relationships between plant physiology and the environment in the formation of yield and similar output traits of interest. Thus, they can explain the impact of G×E and certain types of non-additive gene effects on the expressed phenotype. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a novel and powerful computational procedure, allows the incorporation of CGMs directly into the estimation of whole genome marker effects in WGP. Here we provide a proof of concept study for this novel approach and demonstrate its use with synthetic data sets. We show that this novel approach can be considerably more accurate than the benchmark WGP method GBLUP in predicting performance in environments represented in the estimation set as well as in previously unobserved environments for traits determined by non-additive gene effects. We conclude that this proof of concept demonstrates that using ABC for incorporating biological knowledge in the form of CGMs into WGP is a very promising and novel approach to improving prediction accuracy for some of the most challenging scenarios in plant breeding and applied genetics.},

  abstract = {Multiparental populations are innovative tools for fine mapping large numbers of loci. Here we explored the application of a wheat Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) population for QTL mapping. This population was created by 12 generations of free recombination among 60 founder lines, following modification of the mating system from strict selfing to strict outcrossing using the ms1b nuclear male sterility gene. Available parents and a subset of 380 SSD lines of the resulting MAGIC population were phenotyped for earliness and genotyped with the 9K i-Select SNP array and additional markers in candidate genes controlling heading date. We demonstrated that 12 generations of strict outcrossing rapidly and drastically reduced linkage disequilibrium to very low levels even at short map distances and also greatly reduced the population structure exhibited among the parents. We developed a Bayesian method, based on allelic frequency, to estimate the contribution of each parent in the evolved population. To detect loci under selection and estimate selective pressure, we also developed a new method comparing shifts in allelic frequency between the initial and the evolved populations due to both selection and genetic drift with expectations under drift only. This evolutionary approach allowed us to identify 26 genomic areas under selection. Using association tests between flowering time and polymorphisms, 6 of these genomic areas appeared to carry flowering time QTL, 1 of which corresponds to Ppd-D1, a major gene involved in the photoperiod sensitivity. Frequency shifts at 4 of 6 areas were consistent with earlier flowering of the evolved population relative to the initial population. The use of this new outcrossing wheat population, mixing numerous initial parental lines through multiple generations of panmixia, is discussed in terms of power to detect genes under selection and association mapping. Furthermore we provide new statistical methods for use in future analyses of multiparental populations. A LTHOUGH the recent development of genome sequenc-ing in crop species has strongly increased capacity for gene discovery, the accurate mapping of genes controlling the genetic variation of complex traits (QTL) remains a key objective.

  abstract = {Multiparental populations are innovative tools for fine mapping large numbers of loci. Here we explored the application of a wheat Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) population for QTL mapping. This population was created by 12 generations of free recombination among 60 founder lines, following modification of the mating system from strict selfing to strict outcrossing using the ms1b nuclear male sterility gene. Available parents and a subset of 380 SSD lines of the resulting MAGIC population were phenotyped for earliness and genotyped with the 9K i-Select SNP array and additional markers in candidate genes controlling heading date. We demonstrated that 12 generations of strict outcrossing rapidly and drastically reduced linkage disequilibrium to very low levels even at short map distances and also greatly reduced the population structure exhibited among the parents. We developed a Bayesian method, based on allelic frequency, to estimate the contribution of each parent in the evolved population. To detect loci under selection and estimate selective pressure, we also developed a new method comparing shifts in allelic frequency between the initial and the evolved populations due to both selection and genetic drift with expectations under drift only. This evolutionary approach allowed us to identify 26 genomic areas under selection. Using association tests between flowering time and polymorphisms, 6 of these genomic areas appeared to carry flowering time QTL, 1 of which corresponds to Ppd-D1, a major gene involved in the photoperiod sensitivity. Frequency shifts at 4 of 6 areas were consistent with earlier flowering of the evolved population relative to the initial population. The use of this new outcrossing wheat population, mixing numerous initial parental lines through multiple generations of panmixia, is discussed in terms of power to detect genes under selection and association mapping. Furthermore we provide new statistical methods for use in future analyses of multiparental populations. A LTHOUGH the recent development of genome sequenc-ing in crop species has strongly increased capacity for gene discovery, the accurate mapping of genes controlling the genetic variation of complex traits (QTL) remains a key objective. The principal mapping methods rely on the detection of statistical association between polymorphisms at molecular markers and quantitative variation of phenotypic traits and were historically developed for progenies of biparental crosses with parents chosen for their extreme phenotypes at a trait of interest. These populations are powerful resources for QTL detection, but have low precision as few effective meioses (and thus subsequent recombinations) occur during their development.

  abstract = {Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis allows to identify regions responsible for a trait and to associate alleles with their effect on phenotypes. When using biallelic markers to find these QTL regions, two alleles per QTL are modelled. This assumption might be close to reality in specific biparental crosses but is unrealistic in situations where broader genetic diversity is studied. Diversity panels used in genome-wide association studies or multi-parental populations can easily harbour multiple QTL alleles at each locus, more so in the case of polyploids that carry more than two alleles per individual. In such situations a multiallelic model would be closer to reality, allowing for different genetic effects for each potential allele in the population. To obtain such multiallelic markers we propose the usage of haplotypes, concatenations of nearby SNPs. We developed “mpQTL” an R package that can perform a QTL analysis at any ploidy level under biallelic and multiallelic models, depending on the marker type given. We tested the effect of genetic diversity on the power and accuracy difference between bi-allelic and multiallelic models using a set of simulated multiparental autotetraploid, outbreeding populations. Multiallelic models had higher detection power and were more precise than biallelic, SNP-based models, particularly when genetic diversity was higher. This confirms that moving to multi-allelic QTL models can lead to improved detection and characterization of QTLs. QTL detection in populations with more than two functional QTL alleles (which is likely in multiparental and/or polyploid populations) is more powerful when using multiallelic models, rather than biallelic models.},

  abstract = {Factor analytic variance models have been widely considered for the analysis of multivariate data particularly in the psychometrics area. Recently Smith, Cullis \& Thompson (2001) have considered their use in the analysis of multi-environment data arising from plant improvement programs. For these data, the size of the problem and the complexity of the variance models chosen to account for spatial heterogeneity within trials implies that standard algorithms for fitting factor analytic models can be computationally expensive. This paper presents a sparse implementation of the average information algorithm (Gilmour, Thompson \& Cullis, 1995) for fitting factor analytic and reduced rank variance models.},

When a polymorphism maintained by selection is old, it will have an island of enhanced sequence variability surrounding it, which represents a detectable "signature of selection." We investigate the structure of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 20-kb interval containing the Arabidopsis thaliana disease resistance gene RPS5, a locus containing common alleles for the presencej presence/absence of the entire locus. The alleles are considerably diverged at surrounding sites, indicative of an old polymorphism maintained by selection. The island of "enhanced" variability extends several kilobases to either side of the RPS5 deletion junction, and these SNPs are in nearly complete linkage disequilibrium with the RPS5 insertion/deletion. At a distance of 10 kb to either side of the locus, however, we find low levels of polymorphism and the absence of linkage disequilibrium between individual SNPs and RPS5 alleles. Our results show that the interval of enhanced variability surrounding this balanced polymorphism in Arabidopsis is large enough to be readily detected, but small enough to span the focal gene and few others. For this species it should be possible to identify the complete set of genes with long-lived polymorphisms, a potentially important subset of genes segregating for functional variants.},

  abstract = {Data are presented on the potential of gynogenesis for the production of monohaploids and on factors affecting their frequency and relative vigour. Diploid Solanum tuberosum L. and S. tuberosumxS. phureja Juz et Buk hybrids were used as maternal parents and selected S. phureja clones as prickle pollinators with embryo-spot and nodal band as dominant seed and plant marker. About 2 million seeds were screened for absence of embryo-spot. After raising plants from phenotypically spotless seeds, further screening for absence of nodal bands and for ploidy level was carried out. Finally more than 500 monohaploid plants from three genetically different groups of maternal parents were obtained. Frequency and vigour of the monohaploids were clearly dependent on their maternal genotypes. The data also indicated an effect of the pollinator genotype, the physiological stage of the maternal plant and the environment on monohaploid frequency. On the basis of these results the possibility of breeding for a higher monohaploid production rate and for more stable and vigorous monohaploids is discussed. Furthermore, gynogenesis and androgenesis are compared. It is suggested that both should be used in order to obtain monohaploids from sufficiently various diploid breeding material.},

Here, we describe the positional cloning of the Rpi‐blb1 gene from the wild potato species Solanum bulbocastanum known for its high levels of resistance to late blight. The Rpi‐blb1 locus, which confers full resistance to complex isolates of P. infestans and for which race specificity has not yet been demonstrated, was mapped in an intraspecific S. bulbocastanum population on chromosome 8, 0.3 cM from marker CT88. Molecular analysis of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone spanning the Rpi‐blb1 locus identified a cluster of four candidate resistance gene analogues of the coiled coil, nucleotide‐binding site, leucine‐rich repeat (CC‐NBS‐LRR) class of plant resistance (R) genes. One of these candidate genes, designated the Rpi‐blb1 gene, was able to complement the susceptible phenotype in a S. tuberosum and tomato background, demonstrating the potential of interspecific transfer of broad‐spectrum late blight resistance to cultivated Solanaceae from sexually incompatible host species. Paired comparisons of synonymous and non‐synonymous nucleotide substitutions between different regions of Rpi‐blb1 paralogues revealed high levels of synonymous divergence, also in the LRR region. Although amino acid diversity between Rpi‐blb1 homologues is centred on the putative solvent exposed residues of the LRRs, the majority of nucleotide differences in this region have not resulted in an amino acid change, suggesting conservation of function. These data suggest that Rpi‐blb1 is relatively old and may be subject to balancing selection.},

  abstract = {A novel cropping system for potato was tested for two consecutive years under normal Dutch agronomic conditions. Seedlings from two experimental genotypes of hybrid true potato seeds were produced in a greenhouse nursery and transplanted into the field 5 weeks after sowing to assess tuber yield levels and to study effects of hilling on tuber yield and number, tuber size distribution and tuber greening. Field experiments had a split-plot design with hilling treatments as the main plots and genotypes as the sub-plots. Final harvest was at 122 and 132 days after transplanting in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Hybrid seedlings were transplanted into small initial ridges and irrigated straight after planting. Three hilling treatments were applied between transplanting and 100\% canopy cover. Treatment ‘zero hilling’ did not receive any additional hilling after transplanting. Treatments ‘double hilling’ and ‘triple hilling’ received two and three additional hilling treatments, respectively. Total tuber yields at final harvest in both years were not affected by the hilling treatments. Yields for the respective genotypes were 26 and 30 Mg/ha in 2017 and 25 and 32 Mg/ha in 2018. Total tuber numbers were only affected by hilling treatments in 2017, where under hilled conditions, plants produced more tubers compared with plants under zero hilling. Plants under zero hilling yielded more tubers in size class {$>$}\,40 mm compared with triple hilling in 2017. In 2018, no significant effects of hilling on tuber numbers were found, but the trend was similar to that in 2017.},

  abstract = {An ultradense genetic linkage map with .10,000 AFLP loci was constructed from a heterozygous diploid potato population. To our knowledge, this is the densest meiotic recombination map ever constructed. A fast marker-ordering algorithm was used, based on the minimization of the total number of recombination events within a given marker order in combination with genotyping error-detection software. This resulted in ”skeleton bin maps,” which can be viewed as the most parsimonious marker order. The unit of distance is not expressed in centimorgans but in ”bins.” A bin is a position on the genetic map with a unique segregation pattern that is separated from adjacent bins by a single recombination event. Putative centromeres were identified by a strong clustering of markers, probably due to cold spots for recombination. Conversely, recombination hot spots resulted in large intervals of up to 15 cM without markers. The current level of marker saturation suggests that marker density is proportional to physical distance and independent of recombination frequency. Most chromatids (92\%) recombined once or never, suggesting strong chiasma interference. Absolute chiasma interference within a chromosome arm could not be demonstrated. Two examples of contig construction and map-based cloning have demonstrated that the marker spacing was in accordance with the expected physical distance: approximately one marker per BAC length. Currently, the markers are used for genetic anchoring of a physical map of potato to deliver a sequence-ready minimal tiling path of BAC contigs of specific chromosomal regions for the potato genome sequencing consortium (http:/ /www.potatogenome.net).},

  abstract = {Rice straw is unique relative to other cereal straws in being low in lignin and high in silica. Unlike other cereal straws taller varieties of rice straws tend to be leafy while the leaves are less digested than stems. This may contribute to higher straw value with rice yield. There is genetic variation in straw quality but has not been exploited and tends to be smaller than environmental variation. Effort in plant breeding has been to develop short varieties with higher grain yield. This development has reduced straw quantity but not nutritive value. The relationship between plant genetics and silica metabolism is virtually uninvestigated, although reviews from plant physiology indicate it is a major factor. Silica and lignin in that order are the primary limiting factors in rice straw quality. Silicon is a nutrient element which has been overlooked largely because of its assumed inertness, but also because of its geochemical abundance that so greatly exceeds its metabolic use by plants and animals. Silicon is involved in several major roles in rice: carbohydrate synthesis, grain yield, phenolic synthesis and plant cell wall protection. These vectors interact with each other to eliminate statistical association of silica and lignin with straw digestibility when varieties are compared. Yield of grain is highly related to silica content of straw, which reflects soil availability. There are no detailed studies on rice straw lignin. Most papers reporting lignin contents in rice straw have used acid-detergent lignin by either the sulfuric acid or permanganate versions. There are undoubtedly soluble phenolics in rice straw that need investigation. The effects of ammonia and urea on silica is to crack the silicified cuticular layer. Silica is not dissolved by these reagents in contrast to the action of sodium hydroxide. Treatments on rice straw follow those applied to other lignified materials. In order of frequency of reports, urea followed by ammonia with comparatively fewer papers on sodium hydroxide, steam and pressure treatments or exploded by pressure release, and only one or two papers on acid treatments and white rot fungi. There are reports on animal supplementation and a few growth studies with young animals. Field surveys in India and the southeast Asian countries only report the use of urea, although it appears less efficient than ammonia. Farmer acceptance is related to their perceptions on costs, labor, equipment, health, safety, i.e. the exposure to ammonia vapor, economic and other social factors. The various papers reporting treatments have used animal digestion trials; a variety of in sacco, in vitro digestions with rumen organisms or cellulase, some in combination with pepsin digestion or neutral-detergent extraction. Gas production from in vitro rumen fermentation has also been used. Results are expressed mainly on dry matter basis and fewer reports on organic matter. Results are difficult to compare and standardization of procedures is badly needed. However, most treatments with ammonia and urea show some increase in digestibility and intake where measured in in vivo trials. In vitro and in sacco evaluations tend to overestimate improvement in digestibility.}

Mean yield for the 4x-2x hybrids was equivalent to that of their cultivar parents although yield components, tuber set and average tuber size, were greater and less, respectively, than the cultivar parents. High estimates of general combining ability were found in both pollen and stylar parents for yield, tuber set, marketable yield, number of marketable tubers and hollow heart in all three hybrid populations. Specific combining ability estimates were significant only for yield and hollow heart. Frequency of white-fleshed 4x-2x progeny of five heterozygous yellow-fleshed 2x phureja genotypes was used to confirm cytological identification of a first division restitution mechanism operative in the 2x parents. Although three of these phureja genotypes generated high-yielding progeny, two others produced 4x-2x progeny with mean yield similar to that of hybrids among 4x cultivars.},

Mean yield for the 4x-2x hybrids was equivalent to that of their cultivar parents although yield components, tuber set and average tuber size, were greater and less, respectively, than the cultivar parents. High estimates of general combining ability were found in both pollen and stylar parents for yield, tuber set, marketable yield, number of marketable tubers and hollow heart in all three hybrid populations. Specific combining ability estimates were significant only for yield and hollow heart. Frequency of white-fleshed 4x-2x progeny of five heterozygous yellow-fleshed 2x phureja genotypes was used to confirm cytological identification of a first division restitution mechanism operative in the 2x parents. Although three of these phureja genotypes generated high-yielding progeny, two others produced 4x-2x progeny with mean yield similar to that of hybrids among 4x cultivars.},

Standard diallel analysis methods are applied in order to reveal the presence and mode of action (in terms of GCA and SCA) of undetected polygenes.

Consequently, these genes are expected to exhibit the signature of selection. We screened 501 maize genes for the signature of selection using microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs). We applied the Ewens-Watterson test, which can reveal deviations from a neutral-equilibrium model, as well as two nonequilibrium tests that incorporate the domestication bottleneck. We investigated two classes of SSRs: those known to be polymorphic in maize (Class I) and those previously classified as monomorphic in maize (Class II). Fifteen SSRs exhibited some evidence for selection in maize and 10 showed evidence under stringent criteria. The genes containing nonneutral SSRs are candidates for agronomically important genes. Because demographic factors can bias our tests, further independent tests of these candidates are necessary. We applied such an additional test to one candidate, which encodes a MADS box transcriptional regulator, and confirmed that this gene experienced a selective sweep during maize domestication. Genomic scans for the signature of selection offer a means of identifying new genes of agronomic importance even when gene function and the phenotype of interest are unknown.},

Heritability is an important metric, because it acts as a filter that determines how efficiently phenotypic selection translates into evolutionary change. As a quantity of biological interest, it is important that the denominator, the phenotypic variance, actually reflects the amount of phenotypic variance in the relevant ecological stetting. The current practice of quantifying heritability from mixed effects models frequently deprives the heritability of variance explained by fixed effects (often leading to upward-bias) and it has been suggested to omit fixed effects when estimating heritabilities. We advocate an alternative option of fitting complex models incorporating all relevant effects, while including the variance explained by fixed effects into the estimation of heritabilities. The approach is easily implemented (an example is provided) and allows corrections for the estimation of heritability, such as the exclusion of variance arising from experimental design effects while still including all biologically relevant sources of variation. We explore the complications arising depending on the nature of the covariates included as fixed effects (e.g. biological or experimental origin, characteristics of biological covariates). Furthermore, we discuss fixed effects in non-linear and generalized linear models when fixed effects. In these cases, the variance parameters depend on the location of the intercept and hence on the scaling of the fixed effects.

  abstract = {Genomic prediction methods based on multiple markers have potential to include nonadditive effects in prediction and analysis of complex traits. However, most developments assume a Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Statistical approaches for genomic selection that account for dominance and epistasis in a general context, without assuming HWE (e.g., crosses or homozygous lines), are therefore needed. Our method expands the natural and orthogonal interactions (NOIA) approach, which builds incidence matrices based on genotypic (not allelic) frequencies, to include genome-wide epistasis for an arbitrary number of interacting loci in a genomic evaluation context. This results in an orthogonal partition of the variances, which is not warranted otherwise. We also present the partition of variance as a function of genotypic values and frequencies following Cockerham’s orthogonal contrast approach. Then we prove for the first time that, even not in HWE, the multiple-loci NOIA method is equivalent to construct epistatic genomic relationship matrices for higher-order interactions using Hadamard products of additive and dominant genomic orthogonal relationships. A standardization based on the trace of the relationship matrices is, however, needed. We illustrate these results with two simulated F1 (not in HWE) populations, either in linkage equilibrium (LE), or in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and divergent selection, and pure biological dominant pairwise epistasis. In the LE case, correct and orthogonal estimates of variances were obtained using NOIA genomic relationships but not if relationships were constructed assuming HWE. For the LD simulation, differences were smaller, due to the smaller deviation of the F1 from HWE. Wrongly assuming HWE to build genomic relationships and estimate variance components yields biased estimates, inflates the total genetic variance, and the estimates are not empirically orthogonal. The NOIA method to build genomic relationships, coupled with the use of Hadamard products for epistatic terms, allows the obtaining of correct estimates in populations either in HWE or not in HWE, and extends to any order of epistatic interactions.},

For leaf microbiomes, these results were supported by the observation that broad-sense heritability in hybrids was substantially higher than narrow-sense heritability. ● Our results support our hypothesis that at least some heterotic host traits affect microbiome composition in maize.},

  abstract = {Understanding the quantitative genetics of crops has been and will continue to be central to maintaining and improving global food security. We outline four stages that plant breeding either has already achieved or will probably soon achieve. Top-of-the-line breeding programs are currently in Breeding 3.0, where inexpensive, genome-wide data coupled with powerful algorithms allow us to start breeding on predicted instead of measured phenotypes. We focus on three major questions that must be answered to move from current Breeding 3.0 practices to Breeding 4.0: (a) How do we adapt crops to better fit agricultural environments? (b) What is the nature of the diversity upon which breeding can act? (c) How do we deal with deleterious variants? Answering these questions and then translating them to actual gains for farmers will be a significant part of achieving global food security in the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {Genomic selection (GS) is more efficient than traditional phenotype-based methods in hybrid breeding. The present study investigated the predictive ability of genomic best linear unbiased prediction models for rice hybrids based on the North Carolina mating design II, in which a total of 115 inbred rice lines were crossed with 5 male sterile lines. Using 8 traits of the 575 (115 × 5) hybrids from two environments, both univariate (UV) and multivariate (MV) prediction analyses, including additive and dominance effects, were performed. Using UV models, the prediction results of cross-validation indicated that including dominance effects could improve the predictive ability for some traits in rice hybrids. Additionally, we could take advantage of GS even for a low-heritability trait, such as grain yield per plant (GY), because a modest increase in the number of top selection could generate a higher, more stable mean phenotypic value for rice hybrids. Thus this strategy was used to select superior potential crosses between the 115 inbred lines and those between the 5 male sterile lines and other genotyped varieties. In our MV research, an MV model (MV-ADV) was developed utilizing a MV relationship matrix constructed with auxiliary variates. Based on joint analysis with multi-trait (MT) or with multi-environment, the prediction results confirmed the superiority of MV-ADV over an UV model, particularly in the MT scenario for a low-heritability target trait (such as GY), with highly correlated auxiliary traits. For a high-heritability trait (such as thousand-grain weight), MT prediction is unnecessary, and UV prediction is sufficient.},

Using real and simulated data sets of partial diallel crosses between 266 maize inbred lines, this study investigated the performance of SPDC designs for estimating the GCA. With different distributions of parental lines involved in crossing (called random, balanced and unbalanced samplings), different numbers of hybrids were sampled as the training sets to estimate the GCA of the 266 inbred lines. In this process, three statistical approaches were applied. One obtained estimations through the ordinary least square (OLS) method, and the other two utilized genomic prediction (GP) to estimate the GCA. It was found that the coefficient of determination of each approach was always higher than the heritability of a target trait, showing that the GCA for maize inbred lines could be accurately predicted with SPDC designs. Both the GP approaches were more accurate than the OLS, particularly in the scenario for a low-heritability trait with a small sample size. Additionally, prediction results demonstrated that a big sample of hybrids could greatly help improve the accuracy. The random sampling of parental lines had little influence on the average accuracy. However, the prediction for lines that never or seldom involved in crossing might suffer from much lower accuracy.},

This slow improvement rate is attributed partly to the long generation times of crop plants. Here, we present a method called ‘speed breeding’, which greatly shortens generation time and accelerates breeding and research programmes. Speed breeding can be used to achieve up to 6 generations per year for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum), durum wheat (T. durum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and pea (Pisum sativum), and 4 generations for canola (Brassica napus), instead of 2–3 under normal glasshouse conditions. We demonstrate that speed breeding in fully enclosed, controlled-environment growth chambers can accelerate plant development for research purposes, including phenotyping of adult plant traits, mutant studies and transformation. The use of supplemental lighting in a glasshouse environment allows rapid generation cycling through single seed descent (SSD) and potential for adaptation to larger-scale crop improvement programs. Cost saving through light-emitting diode (LED) supplemental lighting is also outlined. We envisage great potential for integrating speed breeding with other modern crop breeding technologies, including high-throughput genotyping, genome editing and genomic selection, accelerating the rate of crop improvement.},

  abstract = {Advances in sequencing technology allow whole plant genomes to be sequenced with high quality. Combining genotypic and phenotypic data in genomic prediction helps breeders to select crossing partners in partially phenotyped populations. In plant breeding programs, the cost of sequencing entire breeding populations still exceeds available genotyping budgets. Hence, the method for genotyping is still mainly single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays; however, arrays are unable to assess the entire genome- and population-wide diversity. A compromise involves genotyping the entire population using an SNP array and a subset of the population with whole-genome sequencing. Both datasets can then be used to impute markers from whole-genome sequencing onto the entire population. Here, we evaluate whether imputation of whole-genome sequencing data enhances genomic predictions, using data from a nested association mapping population of rapeseed (Brassica napus). Employing two cross-validation schemes that mimic scenarios for the prediction of close and distant relatives, we show that imputed marker data do not significantly improve prediction accuracy, likely due to redundancy in relationship estimates and imputation errors. In simulation studies, only small improvements were observed, further corroborating the findings. We conclude that SNP arrays are already equipped with the information that is added by imputation through relationship and linkage disequilibrium.},

  abstract = {It has recently been shown that structural variants (SV) can have a higher impact on gene expression variation compared to single nucleotide variants (SNV) in different plant species. Additionally, SV were associated with phenotypic variation in several crops. However, compared to the established SV detection based on short-read sequencing, less approaches were described for linked-read based SV calling. We therefore evaluated the per­ formance of six linked-read SV callers compared to an established short-read SV caller based on simulated linkedreads in tetraploid potato. The objectives of our study were to i) compare the performance of SV callers based on linked-read sequencing to short-read sequencing, ii) examine the influence of SV type, SV length, haplotype incidence (HI), as well as sequencing coverage on the SV calling performance in the tetraploid potato genome, and iii) evaluate the accuracy of detecting insertions by linked-read compared to short-read sequencing. We observed high break point resolutions (BPR) detecting short SV and slightly lower BPR for large SV. Our ob­ servations highlighted the importance of short-read signals provided by Manta and LinkedSV to detect short SV. Manta and NAIBR performed well for detecting larger deletions, inversions, and duplications. Detected large SV were weakly influenced by the HI. Furthermore, we illustrated that large insertions can be assembled by Novel-X. Our results suggest the usage of the short-read and linked-read SV callers Manta, NAIBR, LinkedSV, and Novel-X based on at least 90x linked-read sequencing coverage to ensure the detection of a broad range of SV in the tetraploid potato genome.},

Polyploidy is a common feature in many crop plants, like for example banana and blueberry, but also potato which is the third most important crop in the world in terms of food consumption, after rice and wheat. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different training set construction methods using a publicly available diversity panel of tetraploid potatoes. Four methods of training set construction were compared: simple random sampling, stratified random sampling, genetic distance sampling and sampling based on the coefficient of determination (CDmean). For stratified random sampling, population structure analyses were carried out in order to define sub-populations, but since sub-populations accounted for only 16.6\% of genetic variation, there were negligible differences between stratified and simple random sampling. For genetic distance sampling, four genetic distance measures were compared and though they performed similarly, Euclidean distance was the most consistent. In the majority of cases the CDmean method was the best sampling method, and compared to simple random sampling gave improvements of 4–14\% in cross-validation scenarios, and 2–8\% in scenarios with an independent test set, while genetic distance sampling gave improvements of 5.5–10.5\% and 0.4–4.5\%.

  abstract = {Use of genomic prediction (GP) in tetraploid is becoming more common. Therefore, we think it is the right time for a comparison of GP models for tetraploid potato. GP models were compared that contrasted shrinkage with variable selection, parametric vs. non-parametric models and different ways of accounting for non-additive genetic effects. As a complement to GP, association studies were carried out in an attempt to understand the differences in prediction accuracy. We compared our GP models on a data set consisting of 147 cultivars, representing worldwide diversity, with over 39 k GBS markers and measurements on four tuber traits collected in six trials at three locations during 2 years. GP accuracies ranged from 0.32 for tuber count to 0.77 for dry matter content. For all traits, differences between GP models that utilised shrinkage penalties and those that performed variable selection were negligible. This was surprising for dry matter, as only a few additive markers explained over 50\% of phenotypic variation. Accuracy for tuber count increased from 0.35 to 0.41, when dominance was included in the model. This result is supported by Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) that found additive and dominance effects accounted for 37\% of phenotypic variation, while significant additive effects alone accounted for 14\%. For tuber weight, the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) model gave a larger improvement in prediction accuracy than explicitly modelling epistatic effects. This is an indication that capturing the between locus epistatic effects of tuber weight can be done more effectively using the semi-parametric RKHS model. Our results show good opportunities for GP in 4x potato.},

  abstract = {Abstract Multienvironment genomic prediction was applied to tetraploid potato using 147 potato varieties, tested for 2 years, in 3 locations representative of 3 distinct regions in Europe. Different prediction scenarios were investigated to help breeders predict genotypic performance in the regions from one year to the next, for genotypes that were tested this year (scenario 1), as well as new genotypes (scenario 3). In scenario 2, we predicted new genotypes for any one of the 6 trials, using all the information that is available. The choice of prediction model required assessment of the variance–covariance matrix in a mixed model that takes into account heterogeneity of genetic variances and correlations. This was done for each analyzed trait (tuber weight, tuber length, and dry matter) where examples of both limited and higher degrees of heterogeneity was observed. This explains why dry matter did not need complex multienvironment modeling to combine environments and increase prediction ability, while prediction in tuber weight, improved only when models were flexible enough to capture the heterogeneous variances and covariances between environments. We also found that the prediction abilities in a target trial condition decreased, if trials with a low genetic correlation to the target were included when training the model. Genomic prediction in tetraploid potato can work once there is clarity about the prediction scenario, a suitable training set is created, and a multienvironment prediction model is chosen based on the patterns of G×E indicated by the genetic variances and covariances.},

  abstract = {Meat quality describes the attractiveness of meat to consumers. The present paper focuses on two major aspects of meat quality, tenderness and flavour. Both aspects of quality can be influenced by nutrition, principally through its effects on the amount and type of fat in meat. In several countries, high levels of intramuscular fat (marbling fat), i.e. above 30 g/kg muscle weight in \textbackslash textlessspan class='italic'\textbackslash textgreaterlongissimus\textbackslash textless/span\textbackslash textgreater, are deemed necessary for optimum tenderness, although poor relationships between fat content and tenderness have generally been found in European studies, where fat levels are often very low, e.g. below 10 g/kg in UK pigs. Muscle lipid may be a marker for red oxidative (type 1) muscle fibres which are found at higher concentrations in tender muscles and carcasses. Nutritional treatment can be used to manipulate the fatty acid content of muscle to improve nutritional balance, i.e. increase the polyunsaturated (PUFA) : saturated fatty acid value and reduce the \textbackslash textlessspan class='italic'\textbackslash textgreatern\textbackslash textless/span\textbackslash textgreater−6 : \textbackslash textlessspan class='italic'\textbackslash textgreatern\textbackslash textless/span\textbackslash textgreater−3 PUFA value. Increasing PUFA levels may also change flavour because of their greater susceptibility to oxidative breakdown and the generation of abnormal volatile compounds during cooking. This situation particularly applies to the \textbackslash textlessspan class='italic'\textbackslash textgreatern\textbackslash textless/span\textbackslash textgreater−3 PUFA which are the most unsaturated meat lipids. In pigs, a concentration of 3 mg α-linolenic acid (18 : 3)/100 mg in muscle and fat tissue fatty acids can easily be achieved by including whole linseed in the diet. This level has led to abnormal odours and flavours in some studies, but not in others. In cattle and sheep, feeding whole linseed raised 18 : 3 concentrations in muscle fatty acids from about 0.7 mg/100 mg to \&gt; 1 mg/100 mg. As with pigs, this diet also increased levels of long-chain \textbackslash textlessspan class='italic'\textbackslash textgreatern\textbackslash textless/span\textbackslash textgreater−3 PUFA formed from 18 : 3, including eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5). Although this increase led to greater oxidative breakdown of lipids during storage and the generation of large quantities of lipid-derived volatile compounds during cooking, there were no deleterious effects on odour or flavour. When 18 : 3 levels are raised in lamb and beef because of grass feeding, the intensity of the flavours increases in comparison with grain-fed animals which consume and deposit relatively more linoleic acid (18 : 2). In ruminants, very high levels of 18 : 2 produced by feeding protected oil supplements cause the cooked beef to be described as oily, bland or pork-like.},

In pigs, the drive has been to increase n-3 PUFA in meat and this can be achieved by feeding sources such as linseed in the diet. Only when concentrations of α-linolenic acid (18:3) approach 3\% of neutral lipids or phospholipids are there any adverse effects on meat quality, defined in terms of shelf life (lipid and myoglobin oxidation) and flavour. Ruminant meats are a relatively good source of n-3 PUFA due to the presence of 18:3 in grass. Further increases can be achieved with animals fed grain-based diets by including whole linseed or linseed oil, especially if this is “protected” from rumen biohydrogenation. Long-chain (C20–C22) n-3 PUFA are synthesised from 18:3 in the animal although docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6) is not increased when diets are supplemented with 18:3. DHA can be increased by feeding sources such as fish oil although too-high levels cause adverse flavour and colour changes. Grass-fed beef and lamb have naturally high levels of 18:3 and long chain n-3 PUFA. These impact on flavour to produce a ‘grass fed’ taste in which other components of grass are also involved. Grazing also provides antioxidants including vitamin E which maintain PUFA levels in meat and prevent quality deterioration during processing and display. In pork, beef and lamb the melting point of lipid and the firmness/hardness of carcass fat is closely related to the concentration of stearic acid (18:0).},

  abstract = {Wheat straw has a vast potential as feedstock for biofuel production in China. However, little information is available regarding variation in cell wall composition and enzymatic digestibility of wheat straw. This study investigated cell wall compositions and biomass digestibility of the straw of 115 wheat accessions from central China using a 1\% NaOH pretreatment and mixed enzymatic hydrolysis. Significant variation in cell wall composition and sugar release was observed, with a coefficient variation (CV) ranging from 4.7\% to 21.2\%. Cellulose, hemicelluloses, alkali detergent hemicelluloses (ADH), and acid insoluble lignin (AIL) positively correlated with each other, and they all negatively correlated with acid soluble lignin (ASL). Hexose yields had a negative correlation with ADH and AIL, and positive correlation with ASL. No apparent undesirable correlation was found between sugar release and grain yield, thus yield and biomass convertibility can be potentially improved simultaneously. Furthermore, the features of the cell wall constitutions were compared with other plants and their implication in determining the best possible conversion strategy was discussed. This initial study is essential to understand the cell wall composition of wheat straw and to explore the potential of wheat straw as feedstock for biofuel production.},

Our main conclusions are: (i) both GGE biplot analysis and AMMI analysis com- bine rather than separate G and GE in mega- environment analysis and genotype evaluation, (ii) the GGE biplot is superior to the AMMI1 graph in mega-environment analysis and geno- type evaluation because it explains more G+GE and has the inner-product property of the biplot, (iii) the discriminating power vs. representative- ness view of the GGE biplot is effective in evalu- ating test environments, which is not possible in AMMI analysis, and (iv) model diagnosis for each dataset is useful, but accuracy gain from model diagnosis should not be overstated.},

  abstract = {Modeling and detecting nonallelic (epistatic) effects at multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) often assume that the study population is in zygotic equilibrium (i.e., genotypic frequencies at different loci are products of corresponding single-locus genotypic frequencies). However, zygotic associations can arise from physical linkages between different loci or from many evolutionary and demographic processes even for unlinked loci. We describe a new model that partitions the two-locus genotypic values in a zygotic disequilibrium population into equilibrium and residual portions. The residual portion is of course due to the presence of zygotic associations. The equilibrium portion has eight components including epistatic effects that can be defined under three commonly used equilibrium models, Cockerham’s model, F2-metric, and F∞-metric models. We evaluate our model along with these equilibrium models theoretically and empirically. While all the equilibrium models require zygotic equilibrium, Cockerham’s model is the most general, allowing for Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium and arbitrary gene frequencies at individual loci whereas F2-metric and F∞-metric models require gene frequencies of one-half in a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium population. In an F2 population with two unlinked loci, Cockerham’s model is reduced to the F2metric model and thus both have a desirable property of orthogonality among the genic effects; the genic effects under the F∞-metric model are not orthogonal but they can be easily translated into those under the F2-metric model through a simple relation. Our model is reduced to these equilibrium models in the absence of zygotic associations. The results from our empirical analysis suggest that the residual genetic variance arising from zygotic associations can be substantial and may be an important source of bias in QTL mapping studies.},

  abstract = {Modeling and detecting nonallelic (epistatic) effects at multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) often assume that the study population is in zygotic equilibrium (i.e., genotypic frequencies at different loci are products of corresponding single-locus genotypic frequencies). However, zygotic associations can arise from physical linkages between different loci or from many evolutionary and demographic processes even for unlinked loci. We describe a new model that partitions the two-locus genotypic values in a zygotic disequilibrium population into equilibrium and residual portions. The residual portion is of course due to the presence of zygotic associations. The equilibrium portion has eight components including epistatic effects that can be defined under three commonly used equilibrium models, Cockerham’s model, F2-metric, and F∞-metric models. We evaluate our model along with these equilibrium models theoretically and empirically. While all the equilibrium models require zygotic equilibrium, Cockerham’s model is the most general, allowing for Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium and arbitrary gene frequencies at individual loci whereas F2-metric and F∞-metric models require gene frequencies of one-half in a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium population. In an F2 population with two unlinked loci, Cockerham’s model is reduced to the F2metric model and thus both have a desirable property of orthogonality among the genic effects; the genic effects under the F∞-metric model are not orthogonal but they can be easily translated into those under the F2-metric model through a simple relation. Our model is reduced to these equilibrium models in the absence of zygotic associations. The results from our empirical analysis suggest that the residual genetic variance arising from zygotic associations can be substantial and may be an important source of bias in QTL mapping studies.},

We test these ideas using evolutionary measures of sequence conservation to ask whether incorporating information about putatively deleterious alleles can inform genomic selection (GS) models and improve phenotypic prediction. We measured a number of agronomic traits in both the inbred parents and hybrids of an elite maize partial diallel population and re-sequenced the parents of the population. Inbred elite maize lines vary for more than 350,000 putatively deleterious sites, but show a lower burden of such sites than a comparable set of traditional landraces. Our modeling reveals widespread evidence for incomplete dominance at these loci, and supports theoretical models that more damaging variants are usually more recessive. We identify haplotype blocks using an identity-by-decent (IBD) analysis and perform genomic prediction analyses in which we weigh blocks on the basis of complementation for segregating putatively deleterious variants. Cross-validation results show that incorporating sequence conservation in genomic selection improves prediction accuracy for grain yield and other fitness-related traits as well as heterosis for those traits. Our results provide empirical support for an important role for incomplete dominance of deleterious alleles in explaining heterosis and demonstrate the utility of incorporating functional annotation in phenotypic prediction and plant breeding.},

Both analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations were used to achieve these aims. Data were simulated using the Weibull frailty model with two different shapes of the Weibull distribution. Breeding values of 100 unrelated sires with 50 to 100 progeny (with different levels of censoring) were generated from a normal distribution and two different sire variances. For analysis of longevity data on the discrete scale, simulated data were transformed to a discrete scale using arbitrary ends of discrete intervals of 400, 800, or 1200 d. For binary data analysis, an individual's longevity was either 0 (when longevity was less than the end of interval) or 1 (when longevity was equal or greater than the end of interval). Three different statistical models were investigated in this study: a Weibull model, a discrete-time model (a proportional hazard model assuming that the survival data are measured on a discrete scale with few classes), and a linear model based upon binary data. An alternative derivation using basic expressions of reliabilities in sire models suggests a simple equation for the heritability on the original scale (effective heritability) that is not dependent on the Weibull parameters. The predictions of reliabilities using the proposed formulae in this study are in very good agreement with reliabilities observed from simulations. In general, the estimates of reliability from either the discrete model or the binary data analysis were close to estimates from the Weibull model for a given number of uncensored records in this simplified case of a balanced design. Although selection response from the binary data analysis depends on the end of interval point, there is a relatively good agreement between selection responses in the Weibull model and the binary data analysis. In general, when the underlying survival data is from a Weibull distribution, it appears that the method of analyzing data does not greatly affect the results in terms of sire ranking or response to selection, at least for the simplified context considered in this study.},

  abstract = {Most of the maize kernel oil is located in the embryo while the majority of starch is located in the endosperm. Maize kernel composition and value are affected significantly by the ratio of the embryo size to the endosperm size; however, the genetic regulation of embryo to endosperm ratio (EER) in maize is unknown. Here we identified ZmGE2 gene, which encodes a cytochrome p450 protein, as a gene associated with EER variation in maize. We first expressed rice Giant Embryo (GE) gene driven by oleosin promoter in maize and detected a 23.2 \% reduction in EER in transgenic seeds, demonstrating the existence of evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for EER determination in rice and maize. We next identified maize GE2, a homolog of rice GE sharing 70 \% identity in amino sequence, as a candidate based on the similar expression pattern and co-localization with a previously detected QTL for EER. Followed by linkage and association mapping, a 247-bp transposable element (TE) insertion in 3'-untranslated region of ZmGE2 gene was identified to be associated with increase in EER and kernel oil content. Expression level of the favorable ZmGE2 allele containing the 247-bp TE insertion was strongly reduced. In addition, the 247-bp TE insertion site was a selection target during the artificial long-term selection for the high EER trait in a high oil population. This is the first report that demonstrates an association of ZmGE2 with EER variation in maize and identifies ZmGE2 gene as a promising target for manipulation of EER and grain composition by either transgenic approach or molecular breeding in maize.}

We have developed a three-step strategy for identifying heterotic patterns for hybrid breeding comprising the following elements. First, the full hybrid performance matrix is compiled using genomic prediction. Second, a high-yielding heterotic pattern is searched based on a developed simulated annealing algorithm. Third, the long-term success of the identified heterotic pattern is assessed by estimating the usefulness, selection limit, and representativeness of the heterotic pattern with respect to a defined base population. This three-step approach was successfully implemented and evaluated using a phenotypic and genomic wheat dataset comprising 1,604 hybrids and their 135 parents. Integration of metabolomic-based prediction was not as powerful as genomic prediction. We show that hybrid wheat breeding based on the identified heterotic pattern can boost grain yield through the exploitation of heterosis and enhance recurrent selection gain. Our strategy represents a key step forward in hybrid breeding and is relevant for self-pollinating crops, which are currently shifting from pure-line to high-yielding and resilient hybrid varieties.},

  abstract = {The study of gene flow in pedigrees is of strong interest for the development of quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping methods in multiparental populations. We developed a Markovian framework for modeling ancestral origins along two homologous chromosomes within individuals in fixed pedigrees. A highly beneficial property of our method is that the size of state space depends linearly or quadratically on the number of pedigree founders, whereas this increases exponentially with pedigree size in alternative methods. To calculate the parameter values of the Markov process, we describe two novel recursive algorithms that differ with respect to the pedigree founders being assumed to be exchangeable or not. Our algorithms apply equally to autosomes and sex chromosomes, another desirable feature of our approach. We tested the accuracy of the algorithms by a million simulations on a pedigree. We demonstrated two applications of the recursive algorithms in multiparental populations: design a breeding scheme for maximizing the overall density of recombination breakpoints and thus the QTL mapping resolution, and incorporate pedigree information into hidden Markov models in ancestral inference from genotypic data; the conditional probabilities and the recombination breakpoint data resulting from ancestral inference can facilitate follow-up QTL mapping. The results show that the generality of the recursive algorithms can greatly increase the application range of genetic analysis such as ancestral inference in multiparental populations.},

In this paper, we build a general framework for the construction of genetic linkage maps from genotypic data in diploid populations, including bi-and multiparental populations, cross-pollinated (CP) populations, and breeding pedigrees. The framework is implemented as an automatic pipeline called magicMap, where the maximum multilocus likelihood approach utilizes genotypic information efficiently.

The value of a particular cross thus depends on the expected performance of its best progeny, which we call the superior progeny value. Superior progeny value is a linear combination of the mean of the cross's progeny and their standard deviation. In this study we specify theory to predict a cross's progeny standard deviation from QTL results and explore analytically and by simulation the variance of that standard deviation under different genetic models. We then study the impact of different QTL analysis methods on the prediction accuracy of a cross's superior progeny value.

Methods that account for the uncertainty of the QTL analysis by integrating over the posterior distributions of effect estimates also produce better predictions than methods that retain only point estimates from the QTL analysis. The utility of including estimates of a cross's among-progeny standard deviation in the prediction increases with increasing heritability and marker density but decreasing genome size and QTL number. This utility is also higher if crosses are envisioned only among the best parents rather than among all parents.

  abstract = {Missing heritability in genome-wide association studies defines a major problem in genetic analyses of complex biological traits1,2. The solution to this problem is to identify all causal genetic variants and to measure their individual contributions3,4. Here we report a graph pangenome of tomato constructed by precisely cataloguing more than 19\,million variants from 838 genomes, including 32 new reference-level genome assemblies. This graph pangenome was used for genome-wide association study analyses and heritability estimation of 20,323 gene-expression and metabolite traits. The average estimated trait heritability is 0.41 compared with 0.33 when using the single linear reference genome. This 24\% increase in estimated heritability is largely due to resolving incomplete linkage disequilibrium through the inclusion of additional causal structural variants identified using the graph pangenome. Moreover, by resolving allelic and locus heterogeneity, structural variants improve the power to identify genetic factors underlying agronomically important traits leading to, for example, the identification of two new genes potentially contributing to soluble solid content. The newly identified structural variants will facilitate genetic improvement of tomato through both marker-assisted selection and genomic selection. Our study advances the understanding of the heritability of complex traits and demonstrates the power of the graph pangenome in crop breeding.},
