\chapter{About the author}

James was born in the pan-handle of Florida and was raised in the space coast through his childhood. He took to topics related to plant science and biology at a young age. Radicalized by the writings of Sir Albert Howard and Michael Pollan, he entered university and immersed himself in many topics related to sustainable agriculture. By the end of his Bachelors at the University of Florida, James became increasingly interested in the statistical methods of breeding and enrolled at the University of Edinburgh where he studied quantitative and population genetics.
