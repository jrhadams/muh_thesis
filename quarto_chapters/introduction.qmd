# Introduction

## Potato: The crop

Cultivated Potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) is a food crop that has become a staple for billions of people worldwide. Cultivated for its starchy tubers, this vegetable crop has transformed the human diet and contributed significantly to global food security [@Zaheer2016]. Originating from modern-day Peru, potato has a complex evolutionary history which is still under intense scrutiny. Tuber bearing _Solanum_ species (known as _Petota_), represent one of the most diverse sections within the genus. Only recently has the potato lineage been found to have originated as an inter-specific hybrid between Etuberosum and tomato lineages upwards of 9 million years ago [@Zhang2025]. Neither of these ancestral species were tuber-bearing, and only through subsequent evolutionary innovations did tuber formation emerge {}. This hybridization event precipitated an unprecedented radiation with over 100 tuber-bearing species distributed across the Andes stretching from modern-day Colombia to Bolivia [@Spooner2014]. This remarkable diversification was possible through the incredible adaptation of these species to multiple climates and ecological niches.

Domestication of potato is thought to have originated around 10,000 years ago, though still with many questions over its origins [@Spooner2005]. There are two origin theories, namely, a single and multi-origin hypothesis for the domestication of potato. The impact of domestication on potato did not only result in differences in the harvested tubers (e.g. enlargement of tubers reduction of anti-nutrients content like glycoalkaloids), but also  [@Hardigan2017]. Through domestication,  Through the introduction of tetraploid Andean landraces to Europe in the mid-16^th^ century, potato cultivation began to be established in European agriculture. It was not until the introduction and admixture with Chilean potato landraces that potato was adapted to long-day conditions, leading to the widespread adoption and spread of potato across Europe [@DeJong2016; @Gutaker2019].

The origins of selective potato breeding in Europe, like many crops, was quite rudimentary. Just as potato was becoming a universal staple in England and Ireland in the mid-18th century, the growing of potato seedlings was thought by some to to buffer the deterioration observed in extant cultivars, perhaps alluding to the accumulation of pathogen in seed tuber stocks [@Glendinning1983a]. 

## Modern Potato breeding

Many popular varieties in North America and Europe were produced between 1860 and 1900 [@Stevenson1937]. This period of breeding was marked as the most prolific in potato's history with important clones such as Rough purple Chili (~1850) [@Glendinning1983a]. The progeny of these clones have been so valuable to potato growers that they have continued to be cultivated through the 20^th^ and 21^st^ centuries; these include varieties such as Russet Burbank (1908), King Edward (1902), Bintje (1910) [@VanBerloo2007].

3. Lack of genetic improvement in potato (2 Paragraphs)
    i) Less progress in potato relative to other crops
    ii) Replication in early generations
    iii) Impact of polyploidy

Perhaps one of the more underappreciated qualities of potato is the sheer number of traits which beset breeders. The volume of traits aside, many also exhibit complex genotype by environment by management interactions. Quality traits such as starch content, cold sweetening, and skin firmness are especially sensitive to many variables during the dehaulming, harvest, and tuber storage stages [@Jansky2006]. A practical extension of this is that it makes many conversations around potato's lack of genetic progress wanting for nuance. If yield were the only criteria considered, then indeed genetic progress has stalled for certain market segments while showing minor improvements for others [@Douches1996]. Naturally, this stagnation in gross and marketable yield has no bearing on the number of released cultivars the past century [@fig-varieties]. (not to mention, a viable fertility system).

To circumvent many of these known challenges, innovation in next-generation sequencing technologies and molecular biology have aided genetic improvement in potato. Beginning with {}, the first public potato reference genome promised [@ThePotatoGenomeSequencingConsortium2011].
ii) Technologies such as MAS, QTL mapping, genomic selection

These technologies also enable optimizations for typical breeding pipelines for clonal potato.

A popular topic of interest has been to exploit the power of unreduced gametes, as a means for inter-ploidy breeding [@Clot2024b].
i) Discuss alternatives to clonal potato breeding


## Hybrid Potato breeding

By no means a new idea, adapting clonal tetraploid potato to a hybrid breeding schema has been suggested as a method which could circumvent many of the complexities of modern potato breeding. Some have even gone so far as to claim that the stalled genetic progress in potato breeding could be solved with breeding potato as a diploid [@Lindhout2011]. Efforts to breed with diploids are almost as old as the breeding institutions themselves. J.R. Krantz noted quite early the _potential_ ease of inbreeding of diploids over their tetraploid counterparts [@Krantz1946]. The research of Hougas, Peloquin, & Rowe developed further the benefits of diploid-based breeding [@Hougas1958; @Rowe1967].

the incredible success of hybrid breeding [@Crow1998].



The benefits of hybrid breeding in potato extend beyond the practical, but also offer a greater ease of adoption of other technologies. Over the past three decades, many the science and methodology around crop improvement have rapidly developed, especially among field crops. This is the product of 

6. Statistical modelling needed to drive change in potato
    i) Conducting and evaluation of single-trials in potato
    ii) Genotype data
    iii) Phenotypic and genotypic data for large hybrid populations

The emergence of diploid hybrid programs offers a unique opportunity to apply a particular subset of biometrical methodology and breeding designs. Finally, this dataset is a useful snapshot of where 

## Aim of this thesis

With exception of a handful of published studies, there have been few biometrical inspections of the genetic architecture or survey of genomic methods on hybrid potato [@]. This thesis hopes to accomplish this through two primary directives. First I wish to use the same traditional statistical methodologies which were first utilized in other hybrid crops to evaluate the performance of this panel of hybrid potato and assess genetic mechanisms of multiple yield related phenotypes. Second, I seek to use this same population to evaluate modern predictive modelling frameworks to understand what technologies are best wielded in a hybrid breeding program for potato.

**Chapter 2** begins with the evaluation of an F1 hybrid multi environmental trial. This chapter is concerned chiefly with the estimation of intra-trial spatial variation and the statistical delineation of several genetic components of variation, namely, additive and non-additive genetic effects acting in this hybrid crossing block. I consider what these genetic fractions in several tuber traits might impact breeding.

**Chapter 3** examines the potential of multiple METs for the purpose of training genome-wide regression models. This is conducted on several heritable traits with a specific examination of different genetic parameterizations to assess prediction accuracy of each model. The genomic models tested are analogous to those tested in **chapter 2**, with the addition of a model validation procedure designed for F1 hybrid datasets.

**Chapter 4** takes a broader evaluation of genomic models and evaluates their potential in several selection scenarios. Specifically, the efficiency of genomic selection is contrasted against MAS selection schemas based upon putative QTL in a panel of F1 hybrids. The primary aim was to evaluate whether quantitative trait improvement in diploid hybrid potato could be more efficient with MAS based procedures.

**Chapter 5** considers the question of molecular marker information and whether multiallelic marker data has any utility in predictive applications. Two forms of multiallelic information are considered: short range haplotypes (or haplotags) and founder-origin variants (or identity-by-descent based variants). I consider the utility of both forms of multiallelism in a broad survey of predictive genomic models to assess their benefits over that of traditional SNP-based predictors.

**Chapter 6** I conclude with a synthesis of the previous experimental chapters, with a particular interest in addressing how these chapters further biometrical applications in hybrid potato. We conclude by offering a survey of currently under-served topics of research and discuss their relevance to hybrid potato breeding systems.

__Steps with domestication/formalisation of breeding a crop__

This conversion of tetraploid clonal potato into a diploid inbred-hybrid crop can be considered a realisation of a wider effort in crop breeding denoted re-domestication or _de novo_ domestication, wherein novel or related species outside a conventional gene pool are rapidly bred usually through targeting of known domestication genes and pathways via genome editing [(Xie &Liu, 2021)](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/8/4/nwab033/6152298). This is perhaps best exemplified in (Yu et al., 2021) where a process for allotetraploid rice is laid out. 

_De novo_ domestication itself is a facet in a larger movement in breeding described as 4^th^ generation breeding [(Fernie & Yan, 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674205219301297) also known as Breeding 4.0 within some in the quantitative genetic community [(Wallace, Rodgers-Melnick, & Buckler, 2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jason-Wallace-6/publication/328085929_On_the_Road_to_Breeding_40_Unraveling_the_Good_the_Bad_and_the_Boring_of_Crop_Quantitative_Genomics/links/602bca0392851c4ed577af51/On-the-Road-to-Breeding-40-Unraveling-the-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Boring-of-Crop-Quantitative-Genomics.pdf).
