# Potato: a very brief history

Irish Potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) has transformed the diet of billions of people over the last century. Cultivated for its starchy tubers, this vegetable is the third-most grown food crop and is a keystone in global food security [@Zaheer2016]. Originating from modern-day Peru, potato has a complex evolutionary history which is still under intense scrutiny. Tuber bearing _Solanum_ species (known as _Petota_), represent one of the most diverse sections within the genus, comprising over 200 species with varying levels of ploidy and ecological adaptations [@Spooner2014]. Only recently has the potato lineage been found to have originated as an inter-specific hybrid between Etuberosum and tomato lineages upwards of 9 million years ago [@Zhang2025]. Neither of these ancestral species were tuber-bearing, and only through subsequent evolutionary events did tuber formation emerge as a key adaptation for reproduction in high-altitude environments [@Hardigan2017]. This hybridization event precipitated an unprecedented radiation resulting in over 100 tuber-bearing species distributed across the Andes stretching from modern-day Colombia to Bolivia [@Spooner2014]. This remarkable diversification was possible through the incredible adaptation of these species to multiple climates and ecological niches, ranging from high-altitude páramo ecosystems to subtropical valleys.

Domestication of potato is thought to have originated around 10,000 years ago in the Lake Titicaca region of the Andes, but like its early history, aspects of potato's domestication are clouded with questions [@Spooner2005]. There are two primary origin theories, namely, a single domestication event from _Solanum bukasovii_ or multiple domestication events from different wild progenitors. The impact of domestication on potato did not only result in differences in the harvested tubers (e.g. enlargement of tubers, reduction of anti-nutrients content like glycoalkaloids, and changes in tuber shape and skin color), but also altered flowering patterns, photoperiod sensitivity, and reproductive biology [@Hardigan2017]. Through domestication, potato evolved from a short-day adapted plant to one with greater environmental plasticity. The introduction of tetraploid Andean landraces to Europe in the mid-16^th^ century marked the beginning of potato cultivation in European agriculture. It was not until the introduction and admixture with Chilean potato landraces that potato was adapted to long-day conditions, leading to the widespread adoption and spread of potato across Europe [@DeJong2016; @Gutaker2019].

The origins of selective efforts of potato in Europe, like many crops, were quite rudimentary. Just as potato was being adopted by the peasantry in England and Ireland in the mid-18^th^ century, a few prescient observations were made around their propagation. The growing of potato seedlings over seed tubers was thought to buffer the deterioration observed in extant clones, perhaps observing the accumulation of pathogen load over multiple clonal generations [@Glendinning1983a]. Additionally, while a few different "_types_" of potato were observed to be grown in Britain, the reliance on clonal propagation meant that European potato agriculture was one of the first true genetic monocultures with devastating consequences. Between 1845 and 1849, Europe experienced one of the worst famines in its history, due to a continent-wide _Phytophthora infestans_ epidemic infecting all susceptible potato varieties. The Great Hunger in Ireland and related Continental Famine in Europe was responsible for an excess deaths of over 1.1 million people [@Zadoks2008]. While the exact causes of the blight were not rightly known at the time, it was generally understood that there a deficiency in the majority of European potato and that human dependence on this crop necessitated immediate improvement in the crop.

## Modern Potato breeding

By the late 19^th^ century, potato cultivation was expanding across North America. Not only were potato clones being grown, but intenitonal crosses and selection of well-adapted seedlings was becoming commonplace leading to the creation of multiple varieties between 1860 and 1900 [@Stevenson1937]. This period of breeding was not only prolific but also marked by the integration of exotic germplasm from Chile such as Rough purple Chili (~1850) or Daber (~1860) [@Glendinning1983a; @Plaisted1989]. The progeny of these clones have been so valuable to potato growers that they have continued to be cultivated through the 20^th^ and 21^st^ centuries; these include varieties such as Russet Burbank (1908), King Edward (1902), and Bintje (1910) [@VanBerloo2007]. These new varieties were not only carrying valuable resistances to blight and scab, but were also being bred for their valuable starch to satisfy the burgeoning fermentation and processing industries of North American and Europian states [@Willard1993]. Potato's newfound industrial capacity was taking place just as its popularity in its fried form, "_pommes frittes_", was being discovered on a new world stage. Already by the early 1920s, potato production was feeding a multi-faceted global economy as it was being formed in real time.

Once the province of hobbyists, selection of new and better potato varieties began rapid formalization as breeders began to adapt potato to important growing regions through the early 20^th^ century. Between the 1910 and 1950, public breeding institutions were founded in the United States (USDA breeding institutes; 1910), Britain (Scotland's plant breeding station; 1920), India (Potato Breeding Station; 1935), and in China (1940) [@Luthra2006; @Jansky2009; @Bradshaw2009; @Jansky2018]. For many of these institutions,  With many concerned over the genetic base of potato and the preservation of diversity, international genebanks were established and charged with maintaining such germplasm collections; The establishment of the International Potato Institute in 1971 [@Huaman1986].

Over the past 50 years, potato research benefited from incredible advances in molecular and cell biological methodology. Some of the first genetic mapping efforts with restriction and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP and AFLP, respectively) were responsible for the initial mapping for regions providing resistance to _Phytophthora infestans_, Potato Virus X, and _Globodera rostochiensis_ [@Gebhardt1989; @Gebhardt1993; @Meksem1995]. By the late 90's, potato was on the forefront of biotechnological improvement with several transgenic clones targeting traits such as insect resistance and amylose fractions [@Thornton2003; @Karrlson2007]. The first published potato genome made by the Potato Genome Sequence Consortium further enabled advanced methods for genetic discovery such as marker-assisted selection, quantitative trait mapping, and genome-wide selection bringing potato into the era of data-driven genetic improvement [@Visser2009].

### Challenges in potato genetic improvement

Much of potato's history is also a testimony to the many challenges surrounding potato's cultivation. Many potato's incindental aspects of potato's evalution reach through millenia and affect modern-day growers and breeders with many ramifications on modern production systems. Much of these specifically hamper the efficient selection and improvement of potato germplasm, which I highlight below. 

While species within _Petota_ range widely in ploidy number, cultivated potato is almost entirely tetraploid (2n = 48) exhibiting a tetrasomic pattern of inheritance. Potato's autoploidy naturally has some ramifications for breeding. Polyploidy in crops is often described as a sort of double-edged sword in the context of genetic improvement. Multiple genome copies is generally associated with several benefits in crop species including larger organ size, greater _heterotic_ vigour, and more robust performance to sub-adequate climate conditions [@Osborn2003; @Renny-Byfield2014]. These benefits often arise as a response to genome duplication followed by gene-conversion or gene-neofunctionalization which is thought to be a beneficial mode for positive evolptionary selection. Some researchers would describe _Petota_'s polyploidy as one of the major vehicles for its wide environmental adaptaiblity [@Hijmans2007; @Tai2025].

Despite these benefits in an evolutionary setting, polyploidy through the lense of breeding is often described as a challenging process which slows gains. Gene frequencies in tetraploids are strongly buffered from perturbations, making directional selection slower in a tetraploid system relative to their diploid counterparts [@Osborn2003]. This becomes quite clear when consdering a single locus model. Using the single locus model of @Bernardo2002a, we can define the allelic variance at a given locus as the variance of a binomial distribution, i.e.

$$ \sigma^2_p = \frac{p\cdot (1-p)}{l \cdot N} $$

where $p$ is the allele frequency in the population, $l$ is the ploidy number and $N$ is the number of individuals in the population. Comparing two populations (one diploid, $l = 2$, and the other tetraploid, $l = 4$) comprised of 10 individuals ($N = 10$) and an allele frequency of 0.35 ($p = 0.35$), the allelic variance would be 0.011 and 0.0057 in the diploid and tetraploid populations, respectively. Considering how these allelic variances affect the probability of allelic shifts, we can examine the question of a random positive 0.1 shift in the next generation. Evaluating this probability ($P(p \geq 0.45) = 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{0.1}{\sigma_p}\right)$) for both populations results in 0.17 in the diploid population versus 0.09 in the tetraploid population. This demonstrates that gene frequencies even under a simple drift model are buffered from random fluctuations in a tetraploids relative to their diploid counterparts. This has implications in other methods of artificial selection such as inbreeding, marker-assisted selection, or population improvement schemas which extend across multiple loci.

Speed of selection aside, tetraploid potato also carries with it the burden of deleterious mutation load. Like many other polyploid crops, soon after the potato's genome duplication, potato quickly began accumulating deleterious mutations which could not be purged by evolutionary forces due to masking of gene duplication. These were then able to accumulate through potato's clonal propagation strategy as mother plants pass their genome to daughter tubers over multiple generations [@Lian2019]. This process was universal in potato resulting in the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of functionally deleterious mutations among both landraces and cultivated backgrounds of potato manifesting in both zygotic and gametic selection signatures in segregating populations [@Zhang2019; @Song2023]. This directly shows itself in any enterprise attempting genetic improvement in potato. The moment a breeder sexually propagates tetraploid potato and attempts artificial selection among the progeny, the millennia of mutations are then unmasked resulting in incredible phenotypical variances in this first generation.

These large variances observed in segregating tetraploid populations has knock-on effects for artificial selection on tetraploid potato. First, a breeder must generate enough progeny per biparental cross to sufficiently "_sample_" from all genetic perturbations possible from such a cross to increase the likelihood of finding a progeny of higher merit for some trait(s). However, this presents a second challenge of _finding_ that progeny of higher merit among hundreds of thousands of seedlings. This on one hand sounds like a simple problem, but this gets into several other issues unique to clonal crops. In the initial generations, breeders are reliant on true potato seed (TPS) based evaluation which excludes any possibility of replicated evaluations. More problematic, however, is that phenotypic correlations between initial seedling trials and subsequent clonal generations are depressingly low. This limits any phenotypic based selections on tuber and yield characteristics until later clonal generations where sufficient tuber-based propagule is available. The cumulative effect of these factors is a reduced selection accuracy with slower genetic progress relative to other crops [@Gopal2015].


Perhaps one of the more underappreciated qualities of potato is thei sheer number of traits which beset breeders. The volume of traits aside, many also exhibit complex genotype by environment by management interactions. Quality traits such as starch content, cold sweetening, and skin firmness are especially sensitive to many variables during the dehaulming, harvest, and tuber storage stages [@Jansky2006]. Moreover, processing and chipping potato are


A practical extension of this is that it makes many conversations around potato's genetic gain wanting. If marketable yield were the only criteria considered, then indeed genetic progress has stalled for certain market segments while showing minor improvements for others [@Douches1996]. There is some evidence that breeding efforts over the past 60 years have successfully targeted composition and quality related traits [@Hirsch2013]. Naturally, this stagnation in gross and marketable yield has no bearing on the number of released cultivars the past century ([@fig-varieties]). This reflects a difficulty transferring traits between different market segments or potato types meaning genetic improvement in potato tends towards stratification (not to mention, a viable fertility system).


**i) Limited genetic gain in yield**: While potato yields have increased over time, much of this improvement can be attributed to better agronomic practices rather than genetic improvement per se [@]. Genetic gain for yield in potato has been estimated at only 0.5-1.0% per year, significantly lower than the 1-2% annual gains observed in cereals [@Hirsch2013].



### Technological innovations in potato breeding

To circumvent many of these known challenges, innovation in next-generation sequencing technologies and molecular biology have aided genetic improvement in potato. Beginning with the release of the first public potato reference genome in 2011 [@ThePotatoGenomeSequencingConsortium2011], genomic resources have transformed potato breeding. This landmark achievement enabled the development of various molecular tools including:

**Marker-assisted selection (MAS)**: MAS allows breeders to select for desirable traits based on molecular markers linked to genes of interest, particularly useful for traits with low heritability or those difficult to phenotype [@Slater2014].

**QTL mapping and genomic selection**: Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has identified genomic regions associated with important traits, while genomic selection uses genome-wide markers to predict breeding values, accelerating selection cycles [@Endelman2018].

**High-throughput phenotyping**: Automated phenotyping platforms enable more precise and efficient trait measurement, particularly for complex traits like tuber quality and disease resistance [@Cabrera-Bosquet2012].

These technologies also enable optimizations for typical breeding pipelines for clonal potato, reducing cycle times and increasing selection accuracy.

A popular topic of interest has been to exploit the power of unreduced gametes, as a means for inter-ploidy breeding [@Clot2024b]. This approach allows for the transfer of genetic material between different ploidy levels, potentially combining desirable traits from diploid and tetraploid germplasm.

### Alternatives to conventional clonal breeding

Given the limitations of traditional tetraploid clonal breeding, several alternative approaches have been proposed:

**Diploid breeding**: As mentioned earlier, diploid breeding offers simpler genetic architecture and faster selection response [@Lindhout2011].

**True potato seed (TPS) systems**: TPS-based production could reduce seed costs and disease transmission while enabling more efficient breeding cycles [@Almekinders1996].

**Hybrid breeding systems**: The development of F1 hybrid varieties could combine the benefits of heterosis with the genetic uniformity required for commercial production [@Jansky2018].


## Hybrid Potato breeding

Adapting clonal tetraploid potato to a hybrid breeding schema has been suggested as a method which could circumvent many of the complexities of modern potato breeding. Some have even gone so far as to claim that the stalled genetic progress in potato breeding could be solved with breeding potato as a diploid [@Lindhout2011]. Efforts to breed with diploids are almost as old as the breeding institutions themselves. J.R. Krantz noted quite early the _potential_ ease of inbreeding of diploids over their tetraploid counterparts [@Krantz1946]. The research of Hougas, Peloquin, & Rowe developed further the benefits of diploid-based breeding [@Hougas1958; @Rowe1967].

### Historical development of hybrid potato breeding

The concept of hybrid potato breeding gained significant attention with the work of Jansky and colleagues, who proposed a systematic approach to developing inbred lines and F1 hybrids [@Jansky2018]. Their breeding schema involves the development of homozygous diploid lines through selfing, followed by crossing to produce uniform F1 hybrids. This approach leverages heterosis (hybrid vigor) while overcoming the challenges of tetrasomic inheritance in tetraploid potato.

### Genomic-driven hybrid breeding

The conversion to hybrid breeding systems in potato has been accelerated by genomic technologies, enabling several key advancements:

**i) Conversion to hybrid breeding**: Modern genomic tools facilitate the identification and selection of desirable alleles during inbred line development, reducing the time required to achieve homozygosity [@Clot2024b].

**ii) Integration of breeding technologies**: Hybrid breeding systems can more readily incorporate advanced technologies such as genomic selection, marker-assisted selection, and high-throughput phenotyping, creating synergies that accelerate genetic gain [@Endelman2018].

**iii) Utility of TPS-based cropping systems**: True potato seed (TPS) production aligns naturally with hybrid breeding systems, offering potential benefits for seed supply chains including reduced seed costs, improved disease management, and easier storage and transportation [@Almekinders1996].

The incredible success of hybrid breeding in other crops, such as maize and rice, provides a compelling model for potato [@Crow1998]. In these crops, hybrid breeding has delivered substantial yield gains through heterosis exploitation and improved genetic uniformity.

### Statistical and biometrical considerations

The benefits of hybrid breeding in potato extend beyond practical advantages to include greater ease of adopting advanced statistical methodologies. Over the past three decades, the science and methodology around crop improvement have rapidly developed, especially among field crops. This progress is the product of sophisticated statistical approaches that can now be applied to potato breeding:

**i) Design and evaluation of single-trials**: Hybrid breeding enables more efficient experimental designs, including factorial mating designs and diallel crosses, which provide better estimates of genetic parameters [@Bernardo2002a].

**ii) Integration of genotype data**: The diploid nature of hybrid potato simplifies genomic analysis, allowing for more straightforward implementation of genomic prediction models and QTL mapping approaches [@Endelman2018].

**iii) Phenotypic and genotypic data integration**: Large hybrid populations enable the collection of comprehensive datasets that can be used to train predictive models and understand genotype-phenotype relationships across diverse environments.

The emergence of diploid hybrid programs offers a unique opportunity to apply a particular subset of biometrical methodology and breeding designs that have proven successful in other hybrid crops. This represents a paradigm shift in potato breeding, moving from clonal selection to population-based improvement strategies.

## Aim of this thesis

Despite the growing interest in hybrid potato breeding, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive biometrical analyses of its genetic architecture and the application of genomic methods. With the exception of a handful of published studies [@Jansky2018; @Lindhout2011; @Endelman2018], there have been few systematic biometrical inspections of the genetic architecture or surveys of genomic methods applied to hybrid potato. This thesis aims to address this gap through two primary directives. First, I wish to apply traditional statistical methodologies, originally developed for other hybrid crops, to evaluate the performance of a panel of hybrid potato and assess genetic mechanisms underlying multiple yield-related phenotypes. Second, I seek to use this same population to evaluate modern predictive modeling frameworks to determine which technologies are most effective for hybrid potato breeding programs.

**Chapter 2** begins with the evaluation of an F1 hybrid multi-environmental trial (MET). This chapter focuses primarily on estimating intra-trial spatial variation and statistically delineating several genetic components of variation, namely additive and non-additive genetic effects operating within this hybrid crossing block. I consider how these genetic fractions for several tuber traits might impact breeding strategies and selection decisions.

**Chapter 3** examines the potential of multiple METs for training genome-wide regression models. This analysis is conducted on several heritable traits, with specific attention to different genetic parameterizations to assess the prediction accuracy of each model. The genomic models tested are analogous to those examined in **Chapter 2**, with the addition of a model validation procedure specifically designed for F1 hybrid datasets.

**Chapter 4** provides a broader evaluation of genomic models and assesses their potential in several selection scenarios. Specifically, the efficiency of genomic selection is contrasted with marker-assisted selection (MAS) schemas based on putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) in a panel of F1 hybrids. The primary aim is to evaluate whether quantitative trait improvement in diploid hybrid potato could be more efficient with MAS-based procedures compared to genomic selection approaches.

**Chapter 5** addresses the question of molecular marker information and whether multiallelic marker data offers any utility in predictive applications. Two forms of multiallelic information are considered: short-range haplotypes (or haplotags) and founder-origin variants (or identity-by-descent based variants). I examine the utility of both forms of multiallelism through a broad survey of predictive genomic models to assess their benefits over traditional SNP-based predictors.

**Chapter 6** concludes with a synthesis of the previous experimental chapters, with particular emphasis on how these findings advance biometrical applications in hybrid potato. We conclude by offering a survey of currently under-served research topics and discussing their relevance to hybrid potato breeding systems, providing direction for future investigations in this emerging field.

__Steps with domestication/formalisation of breeding a crop__

This conversion of tetraploid clonal potato into a diploid inbred-hybrid crop can be considered a realisation of a wider effort in crop breeding denoted re-domestication or _de novo_ domestication, wherein novel or related species outside a conventional gene pool are rapidly bred usually through targeting of known domestication genes and pathways via genome editing [(Xie &Liu, 2021)](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/8/4/nwab033/6152298). This is perhaps best exemplified in (Yu et al., 2021) where a process for allotetraploid rice is laid out. 

_De novo_ domestication itself is a facet in a larger movement in breeding described as 4^th^ generation breeding [(Fernie & Yan, 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674205219301297) also known as Breeding 4.0 within some in the quantitative genetic community [(Wallace, Rodgers-Melnick, & Buckler, 2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jason-Wallace-6/publication/328085929_On_the_Road_to_Breeding_40_Unraveling_the_Good_the_Bad_and_the_Boring_of_Crop_Quantitative_Genomics/links/602bca0392851c4ed577af51/On-the-Road-to-Breeding-40-Unraveling-the-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Boring-of-Crop-Quantitative-Genomics.pdf).
