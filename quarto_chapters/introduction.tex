\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{Potato: The crop}\label{potato-the-crop}

Cultivated Potato (\emph{Solanum tuberosum}) is a food crop that has
become a staple for billions of people worldwide. This vegetable crop,
cultivated for its starchy tubers, has transformed the human diet and
contributed significantly to global food security \autocite{Zaheer2016}.
Originating from modern-day Peru, potato has a complex evolutionary
history which is still under intense investigation. Tuber bearing
\emph{Solanum} species (known as \emph{Petota}), represent one of the
most diverse sections within the genus. Only recently has the potato
lineage been found to have originated as an inter-specific hybrid
between Etuberosum and tomato lineages upwards of 9 million years ago
\autocite{Zhang2025}. Neither of these ancestral species were
tuber-bearing, and only through subsequent evolutionary innovations did
tuber formation emerge \{\}. This hybridization event precipitated an
unprecedented radiation with over 100 tuber-bearing species distributed
across the Andes stretching from modern-day Colombia to Bolivia
\autocite{Spooner2014}. This remarkable diversification was possible
through the incredible adaptation of these species to multiple climates
and ecological niches.

Domestication of potato is thought to have originated around 10,000
years ago, though still with many questions over its origins
\autocite{Spooner2005}. There are two origin theories, namely, a single
and multi-origin hypothesis for the domestication of potato. The impact
of domestication on potato did not only result in differences in the
harvested tubers (e.g.~enlargement of tubers reduction of anti-nutrients
content like glycoalkaloids), but also \autocite{Hardigan2017}. Through
domestication, Through the introduction of tetraploid Andean landraces
to Europe in the mid-16\textsuperscript{th} century, potato cultivation
began to be established in European agriculture. It was not until the
introduction and admixture with Chilean potato landraces that potato was
adapted to long-day conditions, leading to the widespread adoption and
spread of potato across Europe \autocite{DeJong2016,Gutaker2019}.

\subsection{Modern Potato breeding}\label{modern-potato-breeding}

The beginning of selective breeding in Europe was primaliry concentrated
in the United Kingdom where hobby breeding began focusing on crosses
{[}{]}.

Many popular varieties in north america were produced in the late 19th
century between 1860 and 1900
{[}https://books.google.nl/books?hl=en\&lr=\&id=gs9gQTvtpFMC\&oi=fnd\&pg=PA408\&dq=earl+hobby+breeding+potato\&ots=mEawr2yVH6\&sig=rzncBVFzYolhY3XQ7SQe\_d\_WknU\&redir\_esc=y\#v=onepage\&q\&f=false{]}.

This period of breeding was responsible for creating many of today's
best cultivars including Russet Burbank (1873), King Edward (1902),
Bijntje (1904).

\subsection{The application of Biometrics methods in potato
breeding}\label{the-application-of-biometrics-methods-in-potato-breeding}

One innovation which has captured the imagination of potato breeders for
decades now is the conversion of potato to a diploid hybrid crop. This
is

  \item
    Utility of TPS based cropping systems and supply chains the
    incredible success of hybrid breeding \autocite{Crow1998}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

The benefits of hybrid breeding in potato extend beyond the practical,
but also offer a greater ease of adoption of other techologies. Over the
past three decades, many the science and methodology around crop
improvement have rapidly developed, especially among field crops. This
is the product of

  \item

  \item
    Phenotypic and genotypic data for large hybrid populations
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

The emergence of diploid hybrid programs offers a unique opportunity to
apply a particular subset of biometrical methodology and breeding
designs. Finally, this dataset is a useful snapshot of where

\subsection{Aim of this thesis}\label{aim-of-this-thesis}

With exception of a handful of published studies, there have been few
biometrical inspections of the genetic architecture or survey of genomic
methods on hybrid potato {[}@{]}. This thesis hopes to accomplish this
through two primary directives. First I wish to use the same traditional
statistical methodologies which were first utilized in other hybrid
crops to evaluate the performance of this panel of hybrid potato, assess
genetic mechanisms of multiple yield related phenotypes. Second, I seek
to use this same population to evaluate modern predictive modelling
frameworks to understand what technologies are best wielded in a hybrid
breeding program for potato.

\textbf{Chapter 2} begins with the evaluation of an F1 hybrid multi
environmental trial. This chapter is concerned chiefly with the
estimation of intra-trial spatial variation and the statistical
delineation of several genetic components of variation, namely, additive
and non-additive genetic effects acting in this hybrid crossing block. I
consider what these genetic fractions in several tuber traits might
impact breeding.

\textbf{Chapter 3} examines the potential of multiple METs for the
purpose of training genome-wide regression models. This is conducted on
several heritable traits with a specific examination of different
genetic parameterizations to assess prediction accuracy of each model.
The genomic models tested are analogous to those tested in
\textbf{chapter 2}, with the addition of a model validation procedure
designed for F1 hybrid datasets.

\textbf{Chapter 4} takes a broader evaluation of genomic models and
evaluates their potential in several selection scenarios. Specifically,
the efficiency of genomic selection is contrasted against MAS selection
schemas based upon putative QTL in a panel of F1 hybrids. The primary
aim was to evaluate whether quantitative trait improvement in diploid
hybrid potato could be more efficient with MAS based procedures.

\textbf{Chapter 5} considers the question of molecular marker
information and whether multiallelic marker data has any utility in
predictive applications. Two forms of multiallelic information are
considered: short range haplotypes (or haplotags) and founder-origin
variants (or identity-by-descent based variants). I consider the utility
of both forms of multiallelism in a broad survey of predictive genomic
models to assess their benefits over that of traditional SNP-based
predictors.

\textbf{Chapter 6} I conclude with a synthesis of the previous
experimental chapters, with a particular interest in addressing how
these chapters further biometrical applications in hybrid potato. We
conclude by offering a survey of currently under-served topics of
research and discuss their relevance to hybrid potato breeding systems.
