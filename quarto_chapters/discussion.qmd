# Outline

1. Introductory paragraph contextualising the past chapters (1-2 paragraphs)
    i) The application of quantitative genetic methods is invaluable for the future of potato breeding.
         A. Like other vegetable crops, potato breeding has been marked by _ad hoc_ especially for early selection decisions.
    ii) Here we examined the application of these methods in a hybrid potato breeding program.
    iii) In this general discussion, we provide a synthesis of the previous four chapters with two major aims. First, we wish to identify the direct implications of our research in diploid potato on broader hybrid potato.

2. Summarising the past few chapters (6-8 paragraphs)

    ## Biometrical analysis of field trials

    i) Hybrid yield can be adequately represented by their parental combinations ( chapter 2)
         A. A core concept in hybrid breeding is the ability to assess the potential of hybrid crosses on the basis of parental value.
         B. Our statistical formulation allowed us to present genetic models which produce those breeding values and assess their capture on phenotypes of interest.
    ii) In hybrid potato populations, we can decompose genetic correlations into their predominately additive and dominance components (GCA and SCA as proxies) (chapter 2)
         A. The ability to estimate and assess genetic correlations represent important information for index selection, multi-selection response, and monitoring breeding population changes over time.

    ## Application of molecular marker information

    iii) These same models can be overlaid with marker data for genomic prediction/selection applications. (chapter 3)
         A. The ability to apply genomic prediction in a crop represents a major milestone in hybrid breeding. Because hybrid breeding tends to have longer release cycles, genomic prediction is necessary in hastening informed selection decisions.
    iv) Marker data showed little evidence of structure in population. (chapter 3)
    v) Multiple molecular selection strategies were viable for several traits (chapter 4).
    vi) Potential for multiallelic marker information in predictive modelling (chapter 5).
         A. We examined multiple forms of multiallelic marker information with a focus on differences between IBS and IBD based loci.

    ## Implications

3. Implications of these results (6 paragraphs)
    i) SCA is a genetic residual [@Bernardo2016] (chapter 2)
         A.  Not something worth trying to predict in diploids.
         B.  Using GCA's for selection in young potato populations.
         C. [@Labroo2024]
    ii) Tuber size and dry matter content are better candidates for selection than tuber number
         A.  Sensitivity of tuber number.
         B.  Larger residual variance
    iii) Multi-trait models a benefit for potato breeders. (Chapter 2)
         A.  Index selection can be of direct use to breeders.
         B.  Technical problems applying this in production.
    iv) Technologies like genomic prediction can be applied quite simply
         A.  Require smaller training set sizes relative to tetraploids
    v) Crossing schema for training set development (chapter 3).
         A.
    vi) Model choice is useful but not the most important factor for selection.
    vii) Multiallelism likely a benefit for major QTL, and little else
    viii) Flexibility in Spatial modelling.

    ## Future research

4. Future applications of statistical models (3 - 4 paragraphs)
    i) Multi-trait modelling to estimate genetic correlation between tuber generations
         A.  [@Gopal1998]: GCA does not appear to be very repeatable in early generations, suggesting that even family-based analyses do not give stable components across generations.
         B.  [@Davies1974]: Also examines the lack of suitability in selection in 1-hill stage
         C. [@Maris1988]: Excellent paper looking at the lack of correlation between seedling, first, and second clonal generations.
    ii) IBD founder tracing in pre-breeding generations in potato
         A.  Link to Genome Design [@Zhang2021].
         B.  Access and assessment of tetraploid material.
          - [@Wilson2021]
    iii) Genomic prediction as a vehicle for population change
         A.  You are driving selection of parent development
         B.  Hybrid prediction for coming cycles [@Zhao2015b].
    iv) Risk-based approach for estimating potato sensitivity.
         A. Traditional stability indeces (random regression)
         B.  [@Yazdi2002a]: Example of hazard models in studying longevity of a potential candidate based upon a sire's genetic value.

    iii) Pipeline for new traits for new production systems



## QTL: "_I know it when I see it_"

* It is widely understood that QTL mapping is only useful for turning up large variants and they in themselves cannot reconstitute all of the relevant heritable variation for a trait. Echoing other geneticists remarks on QTL mapping, _"all that glitters is not gold"_. However, as seen in these results they are not without some utility. They can be used for relatively accurate selection assuming that target populations are large enough.


* There are many reasons why a breeder might want to understand the nature of major variants in their breeding program.

* However, unless this is something that either disrupts normal biological processes (severe gametic selection), this likely doesn't need to be 

This can best be segmented into the categories of _nice to know_ and _need to know_. 

## Multiallelism: An unnecessary consideration?

- Breeding is more than just prediction. The use of information by a breeder is not confined to breeding value estimation. 

## Methods should provide insights

Very serious discussion about things.
