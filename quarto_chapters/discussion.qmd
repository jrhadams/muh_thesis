# Outline

1. Introductory paragraph summarising the past chapters 
   i) Hybrid breeding as an answer to conventional breeding
   ii) We examined various genetic parameters which are important to program

2. The necessity of stastical methods in hybrid breeding (previous few chapters) 
   i) Hybrid breeding requires statistical modelling to evaluate genetic variance and trait architecture (chapter 2) 
      A. Can use this for future selection forecasting  
      B. Impact of selection on other traits
   ii) Technologies like genomic prediction can be applied quite simply 
      A. Require smaller training set sizes relative to tetraploids 
      B. You are driving selection of parent development 
      C. Hybrid prediction for coming cycles
   iii) We can evaluate the efficiency of different technologies 
   iv) We can evaluate the efficiency of different models and information

3. Statistical genetic topics critical in potato
   i) Dealing with low seedling and tuber-sown genetic correlations
      A. Touch on seedling versus clonal cropping systems 
      B. Review literature on lack of correlation 
      C. Propose early seedling evaluation and multi-trait prediction models as potential solution
   ii) Evaluating GxE and sensitivity rigorously
      A. Siezing ploidy. Effective tetraploid mining for diploid breeding
      B. Address other breeding strategies such as bridge breeding (Corentin Clot) 

4. Statistical genetic topics crucial in hybrid breeding 
   i) Fertility and seed production in potato inbreds
      A. Affordable production
      B. inbreeding depression
      C. Genetic factors outside _sli_
   ii) Genetic transformation
      A. The collaborative role of gene-editting in quantitative trait improvement
      B. The need for regeneration and transformation as traits 
         - Necessary for Doubled haploids, genetic transformation, and double monoploid production 
         - Genetic variation in response identified in potato 
         - Genes found in other crops [@Koornneef1993]
      C. Building elite inducers [@Delzer2024]
   iii) Pipeline for new traits for new production systems

5. Wrapping up / Conclusions about hybrid breeding in potato 
   i) Current status of hybrid breeding research in potato
   ii) This thesis' place in advancing knowledge about hybrid potato


## QTL: "_I know it when I see it_"

* It is widely understood that QTL mapping is only useful for turning up large variants and they in themselves cannot reconstitute all of the relevant heritable variation for a trait. Echoing other geneticists remarks on QTL mapping, _"all that glitters is not gold"_. However, as seen in these results they are not without some utility. They can be used for relatively accurate selection assuming that target populations are large enough.


* There are many reasons why a breeder might want to understand the nature of major variants in their breeding program.

* However, unless this is something that either disrupts normal biological processes (severe gametic selection), this likely doesn't need to be 

This can best be segmented into the categories of _nice to know_ and _need to know_. 

## Multiallelism: An unnecessary consideration?

- Breeding is more than just prediction. The use of information by a breeder is not confined to breeding value estimation. 

## Methods should provide insights

Very serious discussion about things.
