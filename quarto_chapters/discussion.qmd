# Outline

1. Introductory paragraph contextualising the past chapters (1-2 paragraphs)

2. Summarising the past few chapters (6-8 paragraphs)
    i) Hybrid yield can be adequately represented by their parental combinations ( chapter 2)
    ii) In hybrid potato populations, we can decompose genetic correlations into their predominately additive and dominance components (GCA and SCA as proxies) (chapter 2)
    iii) These same models can be overlaid with marker data for genomic prediction/selection applications. (chapter 3)
    iv) Marker data showed little evidence of structure in population.
    v) For both phenotypic and genomic models, some traits showed higher genetic variance.
    vi) Multiple molecular selection strategies were viable for several traits (chapter 4).
    vii) Potential for multiallelic marker information in predictive modelling (chapter 5).
    viii) Potential for IBD information for genetic value assessment (chapter 5).

3. Implications of these results (6 paragraphs)
    i) Hybrid modelling useful in potato populations (Chapter 2)
    ii) SCA is a genetic residual [@Bernardo2016] (Chapter 2)
         A.  Not something worth trying to predict in diploids.
         B.  Using GCA's for selection in young potato populations.
    iii) Multi-trait models a benefit for potato breeders. (Chapter 2)
         A.  Index selection can be of direct use to breeders.
         B.  Technical problems applying this in production.
    iv) Flexibility in Spatial modelling strategy. (Chapter 2)
    v) Tuber size and dry matter content are better candidates for selection than tuber number (Chapter's 2 and 3)
         A.  Sensitivity of tuber number.
         B.  Larger residual variance
    vi) Technologies like genomic prediction can be applied quite simply (Chapter 3)
         A.  Require smaller training set sizes relative to tetraploids
    vii) Model choice is useful but not the most important factor for selection. (Chapter 5)
    viii) Multiallelism likely a benefit for major QTL, but not genomic selection programs. (Chapter 5)

4. Further applications of models here  (3 - 4 paragraphs)
    i) Multi-trait modelling to estimate genetic correlation between tuber generations
    ii) IBD founder tracing in pre-breeding generations in potato
    iii) Genomic prediction as a vehicle for population change
         A.  You are driving selection of parent development
         B.  Hybrid prediction for coming cycles

5. Wrapping up / Conclusions about hybrid breeding in potato  (2 paragraphs)
   i) Current status of hybrid prediction in potato
   ii) This thesis' place in advancing knowledge about hybrid potato

    i) Hybrid breeding requires statistical modelling to evaluate genetic variance and trait architecture (chapter 2)
         A.  Can use this for future selection forecasting
         B.  Impact of selection on other traits
        iii) We can evaluate the efficiency of different technologies 
    iv) We can evaluate the efficiency of different models and information

3. Statistical genetic topics critical in potato
    i) Dealing with low seedling and tuber-sown genetic correlations
         A.  Touch on seedling versus clonal cropping systems 
         B.  Review literature on lack of correlation 
         C.  Propose early seedling evaluation and multi-trait prediction models as potential solution
    ii) Evaluating GxE and sensitivity rigorously
    iii) Germplasm aquisition and evaluation (pre-breeding topics)
         A.  Siezing ploidy. Effective tetraploid mining for diploid breeding
         B.  Address other breeding strategies such as bridge breeding (Corentin Clot)

4. Statistical genetic topics crucial in hybrid breeding 
    i) Fertility and seed production in potato inbreds
         A.  Affordable production
         B.  inbreeding depression
         C.  Genetic factors outside _sli_
    ii) Genetic transformation
         A.  The collaborative role of gene-editting in quantitative trait improvement
         B.  The need for regeneration and transformation as traits 
              - Necessary for Doubled haploids, genetic transformation, and double monoploid production 
              - Genetic variation in response identified in potato 
              - Genes found in other crops [@Koornneef1993]
         C.  Building elite inducers [@Delzer2024]
    iii) Pipeline for new traits for new production systems



## QTL: "_I know it when I see it_"

* It is widely understood that QTL mapping is only useful for turning up large variants and they in themselves cannot reconstitute all of the relevant heritable variation for a trait. Echoing other geneticists remarks on QTL mapping, _"all that glitters is not gold"_. However, as seen in these results they are not without some utility. They can be used for relatively accurate selection assuming that target populations are large enough.


* There are many reasons why a breeder might want to understand the nature of major variants in their breeding program.

* However, unless this is something that either disrupts normal biological processes (severe gametic selection), this likely doesn't need to be 

This can best be segmented into the categories of _nice to know_ and _need to know_. 

## Multiallelism: An unnecessary consideration?

- Breeding is more than just prediction. The use of information by a breeder is not confined to breeding value estimation. 

## Methods should provide insights

Very serious discussion about things.
