## Introduction

Hastened genetic progress in potato is dependent on the continued application of quantitative genetics methods in breeding programs. Like many vegetable crops, the application of statistical genetic theory has only received significant attention the past two decades in potato. Before this, complex trait improvement in conventional potato breeding was reliant on phenotypic selection and marked by several inefficiencies  including underpowered field evaluations and long release cycles. With the wider application of successful technologies that have had positive success in other field crops, higher success of potato improvement is possible. These include both methods such as variance component estimation, genomic prediction, selection index theory as well as the importing of other breeding schemas like recurrent selection or line breeding.

In this thesis, we consider the conversion of clonal potato to a diploid hybrid crop as an exercise of applied biometrical methods. To our knowledge, this thesis is the first to interrogate the genetic architecture of a hybrid potato population and assess both features in these populations and the adequacy of specific statistical methods applied to them. This was the form our questions took throughout this thesis. We first examined the genetical properties of the F1 hybrid seedling trials including genetic correlations between multiple tuber yield components (chapter 2; @Adams2022). We also considered the population structure of these hybrids with the introduction of inbred molecular marker information (chapter 3; @Adams2023) as well as with ancestral founder profiles (chapter 5). After having estimated these genetic parameters, we tested multiple predictive modelling methodologies testing the marginal gains of predicting dominance effects (chapter 3; @Adams2023), potential benefits of marker assisted selection for complex traits (chapter 4), and various multiallelic parameterisations for genome-wide regression (chapter 5). These topics cover an important range of topics for modern selection methods in a potato breeding program.

Here we provide a synthesis of the previous four experimental chapters with two major aims. We first wish to identify the most important findings of this research, and second, outline the direct implications of our research on potato more generally. We then conclude this thesis with reflections on future research.

### Biometrical analysis of field trials

A core activity in breeding programs is the regular evaluation of new parental combinations to screen for genetically improved offspring. For this reason, within-trial and multi-environmental trial design is so heavily emphasised for sufficient statistical power and optimal resource allocation [@]. This permits proper extraction of spatial and other non-genetic components in a field trial and unbiased evaluation of genotype performance. From this successful spatial analysis, we are then able to measure the genetic parameters of interest whether it be comparison of genotype means, or the estimation of genetic correlations between traits.

In conventional potato breeding, formal trial analysis is traditionally reserved in the C1 or C2 generations when there is a sufficient number of clones for replication [@Gopal2015; @Paget2017]. This is in contrast to other field crops where true seed is the predominant propagule and usually allows for suitable replication after the initial crossing depending on the stage of the candidates [@Zystro2018]. An overlooked property of hybrid breeding in potato is the necessity of true seed and the ability to conduct uniform trialling on seed sown or transplants with multi-plant plots rather than single plant hills. This design decision of course carries with it consequences, chief among them, being poor correlation in multiple tuber traits between the seedling S1 and clonal generations [@Anderson1981]. This is addressed in full in @sec-implications, but suffice it to say that the field evaluation of hybrid potato in the S1 generation provides opportunities for explicit field design with sufficiently high precision for multiple tuber phenotypes [@VanDijk2021a].

In **chapter 2**, such an exercise was conducted in the form of a multi-trial analysis on several hundred F1 hybrids. A penalized splines based procedure was used for spatially de-trending our hybrid observations for three tuber phenotypes. These de-trended phenotypes were then placed in a multivariate linear mixed model for the estimation of the genetic (co-)variances for the GCA, SCA, and several interactive effects. In **chapter 3**, this was followed up with a traditional linear mixed modelling procedure where multiple row column designs with various residual structures were tested on an augmented dataset [@Gilmour1997]. The BLUEs and standard errors from these models where then used in a full genomic model where genomically estimated BLUPs were evaluated in a cross-validation schema. Both modelling procedures from these chapters follow the general form of a two-stage mixed model analysis where trials are independently analyzed followed by an combined analysis on the genotypic means (most commonly) together with weights on those genotypic observations [@Piepho2012]. Its generally known that two-stage approaches tend to be less accurate than than their single stage counterparts especially with greater model complexity [@Gogel2018]. All this being said, single-stage approaches tend to be unwieldy in their specification and computation and the consequences of a two-stage approach are unlikely to change any inferential conclusions from these two chapters [@Damesa2017].

A core concept in hybrid breeding is the ability to assess the potential of hybrid crosses on the basis of parental value. In the case for phenotypic selection, general combining abilities tend to be the primary mode which communicates a line's value [@Bertan2007]. In **chapter 2** we generated GCAs for 400 parental lines in multiple tuber variates and found that the GCAs sufficiently captured a large portion of the phenotypic variation in the F1 screening trials. The use of GCA for selection is not unique to hybrid crops with many examples of their use in tetraploid potato as well [@Neele1991; @Bradshaw2003]. This is despite many tetraploid studies reporting a large proportion of non-additive genetic effects controlling tuber qualities like tuber size, tuber yield, and marketable yield [@Plaisted1962; @Tai1976 ;@Killick1977]. This hints at well known utility of diploid-based breeding and that is a simpler genetic architecture in contrast to their polyploid counterparts [@Osborn2003]. In breeding applications this manifests itself in .


From **chapter 2**, some insight around the genetic architecture of yield components was gleaned in the form of genetic correlations. Not only were we able to extract the covariance parameters for overall genetic covariance, but also express this per GCA and SCA variance. This is worth re-emphasis. First, potato is a crop has a relatively large trait surface comprising tens of traits of interest [@Gebhardt2013], many of them being complex with low heritabilities and non-independent relationships. Because of this there is a real need to better utilize multivariate methods in genetic improvement in potato. In addition, hybrid breeding schemas are also augmented by multivariate methods whether based upon phenotype alone or also for multivariate genomic prediction applications [@Wang2017]. To lend some credence to multivariate applications in potato, we can consider the genetic covariances for GCA's from Figure \ref{fig:gca-coef-full-pairs} together with their full phenotypic variance matrix. Assuming the GCA variances estimated here would be roughly equivalent to those estimated from a test cross schema in a hybrid breeding program, we could estimate the following selection response using the multivariate breeder's equation as expressed by @Lande1983. If we performed truncation selection on tuber volume (s = 2 $cm^3$) and conducted random inter-mating between candidates, then the expected selection response can be estimated as follows:

```{R get-covariances}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
library(data.table)
library(glue)
#Get your variance components from the first chapter
vrs <- fread("./assets/VarianceComponentsFullModel.csv")
#extract trait 1 and trait 2 and component
tr <- c("TV", "TY", "TN")
#init matrix
m <- matrix(NA, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, dimnames = list(tr, tr))

#filter and prepare your variances
setnames(vrs, 1, "effect")
vrs <- vrs[effect != "units:trait!R"]
rgx <- "^(.*)!trait_(.*):(.*)$"
vrs[, c("eff", "tr1", "tr2") := tstrsplit(gsub(rgx, "\\1 \\2 \\3", effect), " ")
    ][, c("effect", "std.error", "z.ratio", "bound", "%ch") := NULL]
#Get the opposite side of diagonal
full <- rbind(vrs, vrs[tr1 != tr2, .(component, eff, tr1 = tr2, tr2 = tr1)])
#last but not least but scale the additive effects correctly
full[eff == "trait:dam", component := component * 2]

#Get your matrices
vList <- lapply(split(full, full$eff), \(f) {
  m[f[, cbind(tr1, tr2)]] <- f$component
  m
})
P <- Reduce(`+`, vList)
G <- vList$`trait:dam`
Pinv <- solve(P)
S <- c(2, 0, 0)
R <- G %*% Pinv %*% S

# do ungodly things to get your latex
#Get g text
Gtext <- paste0(apply(round(G, 2), 1, paste0, collapse = " & "),
                collapse = " \\\\ ")
#then P
Pinvtext <- paste0(apply(round(Pinv, 2), 1, paste0, collapse = " & "),
                   collapse = " \\\\ ")
#and S
stext <- "\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}"
#and finally R
Rtext <- paste0(apply(round(R, 2), 1, paste0, collapse = " & "),
                collapse = " \\\\ ")
#hella messy
lat <- glue("$$ \\mathrm {{R = G \\cdot P^{{-1}} \\cdot S}}$$
  $$ \\mathrm {{R}} = \\begin{{bmatrix}}{Gtext}\\end{{bmatrix}}\\cdot\\begin{{bmatrix}}{Pinvtext}\\end{{bmatrix}} \\cdot {stext} $$
  $$\\mathrm {{R}} = \\begin{{bmatrix}}{Rtext}\\end{{bmatrix}}$$")
lat
```

This would suggest a mean increase of about 1.5 $cm^3$ in tuber volume with a minor increase in total tuber yield and little change in tuber number. This of course could be taken a step further and transformed into an index using a variety of methods [@Kempthorne1959; @Bulmer1981]. More attention is needed here to make these methods more scalable in applied settings. Traditional linear mixed modelling tends to be impractical with more than 10 variates making other methods such as Bayesian learning more attractive [@Blows2009; @Runcie2013].

### Genomic prediction in hybrid potato

Crop improvement, like many activities, is dependent on well-informed and expedient decision-making. More than any other technology the past couple decades, genomic prediction is responsible for rapid gains in crop breeding. Before the advent of molecular marker information, the genetic value of a candidate could be predicted through the use of pedigree [@Henderson1973]. However, the utility of such an approach is quickly stymied in highly related populations or in shallow pedigreed populations. Only after the introduction of the first marker technologies 40 years ago, was more resolution possible making prediction of genetic value interesting in field crops [@Bernardo1994]. Particularly for hybrid crops, the application of genomic prediction is crucial for hastening genetic progress via modification of cycle length, ... [@Zhao2015b]. Relevant questions to the successful implementation of genomic prediction in a new crop include marker density, training set composition, and trait inspection.

Multiple chapters in this thesis addressed genomic prediction applications in hybrid potato. In **chapter 3**, we built on the partitioned GCA and SCA models from **chapter 2** and incorporated molecular marker information to structure the each genetic component. Multiple genomic models were then tested in a predictive application testing  a simple and full genetic model (GCA, and GCA+SCA, respectively) for the same tuber variates from **chapter 2** along with tuber dry matter content. Testing the predictive model performance between each model showed very little marginal gains through the addition of the SCA component in the model. Contrasting the SCA variance relative to the genetic residual suggested that there were other genetic effects that were not captured in either of the other genetic effects, most notably in total tuber number and dry matter content. Through this modelling schema, we were able to confirm that genomic prediction solely on the basis of GCA sufficed in the estimation of a hybrid cross genetic for all tuber variates studied.

These prediction models were extended further in **chapter 5** by examining several other statistical paradigms and assessing any benefits to multiallelic marker information. We drew our attention specifically to the utility of IBD information derived from deep pedigree information linking ancestral founders to the parent's of hybrids along with multiallelic IBS information. Both types of marker information were compared with conventional biallelic SNPs using traditional shrinkage-based models along with more complicated kernel prediction. For all tuber variates, the SNP based models were superior than their multiallelic counterparts, though this was most apparent for the IBD based markersets. Similarly, we found little differences between the different modelling methods, with exception that the Gaussian kernel tended to maximize prediction accuracy regardless of trait and markerset. These results would suggest that in the context of genomic prediction, simpler marker parameterisations tend to yield more consistent results, though they might very well have other suitable applications.

### Methods of selection

- 21st century breeding programs are met with many choices with regard to different technologies into their an embarrassment of riches
- Breeding programs have undergone substantial transformations with the introduction of alternative methods of selection.

The topic of selection strategy in hybrid potato was tackled in **chapter 4**. The primary exercise was to estimate the selection efficiency of our marker-assisted selection strategy (MAS), a linkage-based control (PC), and genome-wide prediction (GP) for the prediction of an inbred parent's breeding value. Based upon a forward-selection procedure, 33 unique QTLs were found across three traits (total tuber number was excluded). These QTL were able to pick up between 54 and 56 per cent of the background genetic variation and were the primary basis for prediction in the MAS models. Examining prediction accuracy alone, the GP strategy was evidently for all phenotypes based upon the cross-validation strategy, though, MAS performed well despite accounting for only a fraction of the genetic variation.  , however, with the incorporation of cost of marker sampling, we 
    v) Multiple molecular selection strategies were viable for several traits (chapter 4).

## Wider Implications

### What kind of hybrid potato?

 - SCA is a genetic residual [@Bernardo2016] (chapter 2)
         A.  Not something worth trying to predict in diploids.
         B.  Using GCA's for selection in young potato populations.
         C. [@Labroo2023]
  -  SCA variance tends to be ignored where there are genetically distinct heterotic pools, but not so for those without [@Zhao2015b]
 - All of this depends on what kind of hybrid crop potato will be.
  - [@DeJong2023]
-  Genomic selection tends to give excellent opportunities in heterotic breeding efforts [@Labroo2023].

### Multivariate applications for potato breeders. {#sec-implications}

Future applications of statistical models (3 - 4 paragraphs)
    i) Multi-trait modelling to estimate genetic correlation between tuber generations
         A.  [@Gopal1998]: GCA does not appear to be very repeatable in early generations, suggesting that even family-based analyses do not give stable components across generations. Change in genetic correlations per generation.
         B.  [@Davies1974]: Also examines the lack of suitability in selection in 1-hill stage
         C. [@Maris1988]: Excellent paper looking at the lack of correlation between seedling, first, and second clonal generations.

         A.  Index selection can be of direct use to breeders.
         B.  Technical problems applying this in production.

### Successful genomic prediction in hybrid potato

Model choice is useful but not the most important factor for selection.
As documented in other crops, often more important than the minutia of specific genetic parameterisations is the actual composition of a training set [@Dias2019]. 
An additional point can also be made regarding molecular marker information. A recurrent topic in our field is the importance of marker density and adequately tagging every linkage block in segregating regions in a population. For our study we used a probeset with a relatively low genome coverage and still found remarkable success according to our cross-validation schema.
    iv) Technologies like genomic prediction can be applied quite simply
         A.  Require smaller training set sizes relative to tetraploids
         A.
  - The ability to apply genomic prediction in a crop represents a major milestone in hybrid breeding. Because hybrid breeding tends to have longer release cycles, genomic prediction is necessary in hastening informed selection decisions.
 iii) Genomic prediction as a vehicle for population change
         A.  You are driving selection of parent development
         B.  Hybrid prediction for coming cycles [@Zhao2015b].
   vii) Multiallelism likely a benefit for major QTL, and little else

    v) Crossing schema for training set development (chapter 3).

## Future research

There are still many facets of potato breeding which could be improved with further biometrical applications. We consider here the role of quantititive genetics for improved fertility, pre-breeding methodology, and breeding risk assessment for more robust potato breeding.

![(left) The classic breeder's equation where genetic gain is a linear function of selection intensity, selection accuracy, and the genetic standard deviation divided by the length of cycle and breeder's risk (right) which is the product of selection intensity, the compliment of selection accuracy, and the genetic by environment standard deviation divided by the number of trials.](./assets/selection_risk.pdf){#fig-risk width=80%}

Fertility is a crucial factor for any seed-based crop. This is especially true in hybrid breeding systems where often the cost price is dependent on an affordable and reliable seed production system [@Mao1998; @Longin2014]. The typical targets for fertility in hybrid crops are pollen shed, sufficient pollen viability, and synced male and female flower opening, such that seed production is unencumbered [@Longin2012]. Most genetical research in potato fertility for several decades has _rightly_ been focussed on large effect loci like _Sli_ or important genes in wider fertility modules like _StCDF1_ [@Clot2020; @Eggers2021; @Song2022]. As these loci continue to be used and fixed in breeding populations, an important future step will be to assess this broader array of traits in potato populations [@Kempe2011]. This will also involve a greater undertaking of measuring and managing high deleterious load, one of the primary sources of low fertility in diploid potato populations [@]. An impressive strategy  [@Zhang2021]. [@Wallace2018]

A currently under-served corner in the genetic improvement of potato is the identification of novel germplasm for complex trait improvement. The specific challenge of identifying superior candidates among tetraploids for diploid potato programs is laced with multiple hazards. First, the genetic architectures of diploid and tetraploids are not equivalent TODO {go into this }[@Neele1991], or at the very least, attempts at genetic models containing both polyploid and diploid potato do not suggest a homogeneous relationship between phenotype and genotype [@Wilson2021]. In **chapter 5**, we considered 
    ii) IBD founder tracing in pre-breeding generations in potato
         A.  Link to Genome Design [@Zhang2021].
    

Often, while considering a novel technology or more efficient breeding schema, the first question asked is _"What kind of genetic gains can be expected with this implementation"_? This in of itself is not unsound, but without asking _"what are the risks of such an implementation"_ biometricians run the risk of overly optimistic forecasting. This addendum is especially pertinent for potato breeders due to many of the aforementioned challenges, chief among them, environmental sensitivity [@George2017]. Formalizing the estimation of explicit risk of a breeding strategy is the province of quantitative genetics and this deserves greater attention. To this end, we can conceptualize an analogue to the classic breeder's equation where the potential risk tradeoffs associated with such a strategy are manifest ([@fig-risk]). For example, decreasing the cycle length of a schema by reducing the number of years of trial evaluation can technically hasten genetic gain. Naturally, however, this would also increase the risk or uncertainty around these candidates if you have exposed them to an insufficient number of environments. Embracing other tools might also bring risk to the forefront; methods like random regression for estimating stability or borrowing hazard models from the animal breeding world could be useful for assessing the stability of a potential candidate [@Yazdi2002a; @Souza2020].

## QTL: "_I know it when I see it_"

* It is widely understood that QTL mapping is only useful for turning up large variants and they in themselves cannot reconstitute all of the relevant heritable variation for a trait. Echoing other geneticists remarks on QTL mapping, _"all that glitters is not gold"_. However, as seen in these results they are not without some utility. They can be used for relatively accurate selection assuming that target populations are large enough.


* There are many reasons why a breeder might want to understand the nature of major variants in their breeding program.

* However, unless this is something that either disrupts normal biological processes (severe gametic selection), this likely doesn't need to be 

This can best be segmented into the categories of _nice to know_ and _need to know_. 

## Multiallelism: An unnecessary consideration?

- Breeding is more than just prediction. The use of information by a breeder is not confined to breeding value estimation. 

## Methods should provide insights

Very serious discussion about things.
