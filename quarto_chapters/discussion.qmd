## Introduction

Hastened genetic progress in potato is dependent on the continued application of quantitative genetics methods in breeding programs. Like many vegetable crops, the application of statistical genetic theory has only received significant attention the past two decades in potato. Before this, complex trait improvement in conventional potato breeding was reliant on phenotypic selection and marked by several inefficiencies  including underpowered field evaluations and long breeding cycles [@Bradshaw2017]. With the continued application of technologies that have had positive success in other field crops, increased genetic improvement in potato is possible. These include both methods such as variance component estimation, genomic prediction, selection index theory as well las the importing of other breeding schemas like recurrent selection or line breeding.

In this thesis, we consider the conversion of clonal tetraploid potato to a diploid hybrid crop as an exercise of applied biometrical methods. To our knowledge, this thesis is the first to interrogate the genetic architecture of a large F1 crossing block in diploid hybrid potato. Moreover, these past experimental chapters also took the opportunity to assess the adequacy of multiple statistical methods in the estimation and prediction of genetic value in this novel crop. We first examined the genetical properties of the F1 hybrid seedling trials including genetic correlations between multiple tuber yield components (chapter 2; @Adams2022). We also utilized multiple forms of genetic information to assess the family history of the inbred parental lines. This included the use of pedigree and molecular marker information (chapter 3; @Adams2023) as well as identity by descent profiles (chapter 5) to evaluate the population structure of these parental lines. After having estimated these genetic parameters, we tested multiple predictive modelling methodologies testing the potenial benefits of predicting dominance effects (chapter 3; @Adams2023), the utility of marker assisted selection for complex traits (chapter 4), and various multiallelic parameterisations for genome-wide regression (chapter 5). These topics cover an important range of topics for modern selection methods in a potato breeding program.

Here we provide a synthesis of the previous four experimental chapters with two major aims. We first wish to identify the most important findings of this research, and second, outline the direct implications of our research on potato breeding more generally. We then conclude this thesis with reflections on future research.

### Biometrical analysis of field trials

A core activity in breeding programs is the regular evaluation of new parental combinations to screen for genetically improved offspring. Identification of suitable and informative trialling locations ensures an unbiased and representative assessment of a candidate's performance. For this reason, within-trial and multi-environmental trial design is so heavily emphasized in modern crop literature for sufficient statistical power and optimal resource allocation [@Shoemaker2024]. This permits proper extraction of spatial and other non-genetic components in a field trial and unbiased evaluation of genotype performance. From this successful spatial analysis, we are then able to measure the genetic parameters of interest whether it be comparison of genotype means, or the estimation of genetic correlations between traits.

In conventional potato breeding, formal trial evaluation is traditionally reserved for the 1st or 2nd clonal generations (C1 and C2, respectively) when enough clonal propagule can guarantee sufficient replication [@Gopal2015; @Paget2017]. This is in contrast to other field crops where true seed is the predominant source of germplasm and allows for suitable replication after the initial cross or selfing [@Zystro2018]. An overlooked property of hybrid breeding in potato is the necessity of true seed and the ability to conduct trialing on multi-plant plots over traditional tuber-sown hills (commonplace in the first clonal generation with traditional potato) [@Davies1974; @Pallais1991]. The latter tend to be underpowered with too low of precision for early selection making true potato seed a powerful resource in breeding germplasm evaluation [@Storck2011; @Stockem2021]. This is not without negative consequences, chief among them, being the poor correlation in multiple tuber traits between the seedling and clonal generations [@Ortiz1997; @Anderson1981]. This is addressed in full in @sec-implications, but suffice it to say that the field evaluation of hybrid potato via seedling transplants provides opportunities for explicit field design with sufficiently high precision for multiple tuber phenotypes [@VanDijk2021a].

In **chapter 2**, such an exercise was conducted in the form of a multi-trial analysis on several hundred F1 hybrids. A penalized splines based procedure was used for spatially de-trending our hybrid observations for three tuber phenotypes. These de-trended phenotypes were then placed in a multivariate linear mixed model for the estimation of the genetic (co-)variances for the GCA, SCA, and several interactive effects. In **chapter 3**, this was followed up with a traditional linear mixed modelling procedure where multiple row column designs with various residual structures were tested on an augmented dataset [@Gilmour1997]. The BLUEs and standard errors from these models where then used in a full genomic model where genomically estimated BLUPs were evaluated in a cross-validation schema. While the spatial modelling procedures from **chapter 2** and **chapter 3** were derived from two different frameworks, we found little to no difference between the use of semi-parametric Spline functions and structuring our residual variance. Previous studies have also suggested these approaches as equivalent with exception of the ease of a single model-fitting over the testing of multiple linear mixed models [@Velazco2017]. Both modelling procedures from these chapters follow the general form of a two-stage mixed model analysis where trials are independently analyzed followed by an combined analysis on the genotypic means (most commonly) together with weights on those genotypic observations [@Piepho2012]. Two-stage approaches are understood to be generally less accurate than than their single stage counterparts especially with greater model complexity [@Gogel2018]. All this being said, single-stage approaches tend to be unwieldy in their specification and computation and the consequences of a two-stage approach are unlikely to change any inferential conclusions from these two chapters [@Damesa2017].

A core concept in hybrid breeding is the ability to assess the potential of hybrid crosses on the basis of parental value. In the case for phenotypic selection, general combining abilities tend to be the primary mode which communicates a line's value [@Bertan2007]. In **chapter 2** we generated GCAs for 400 parental lines in multiple tuber variates and found that the GCAs sufficiently captured a large portion of the phenotypic variation in the F1 screening trials. The use of GCA for selection is not unique to hybrid crops with many examples of their use in tetraploid potato in many modern applications as well [@Neele1991; @Bradshaw2003]. This is despite many tetraploid studies reporting a large proportion of non-additive genetic effects controlling tuber qualities like tuber size, tuber yield, and marketable yield [@Plaisted1962; @Tai1976 ;@Killick1977]. This suggests an additional utility of diploid-based breeding with a simpler genetic architecture in contrast to their polyploid counterparts [@Osborn2003]. This is evident even while examining a single-locus model. Considering the allelic standard error of a locus ($\sigma_p = \sqrt{\frac{p\cdot (1-p)}{l \cdot N}}$) in a population of 10 individuals ($N = 10$) and an allele frequency of 0.35 ($p = 0.35$), the error would be 0.11 and 0.075 in a population of diploids ($l = 2$) and tetraploids ($l = 4$), respectively. The probability of a 0.1 positive shift in allele frequency ($P(p \geq 0.45) = 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{0.1}{\sigma_p}\right)$) would then be 0.17 in the diploid population versus 0.09 in the tetraploid population. This is to demonstrate that gene frequencies are buffered from perturbations making any directional selection in a tetraploid breeding program slower than in their diploid counterpart. This impacts  many aspects of breeding whether targeting a single locus (e.g. marker-assisted selection) or attempting multi-locus selection (e.g. recurrent selection, selfing).

From **chapter 2**, some insight around the genetic architecture of yield components was gleaned in the form of genetic correlations. This was not just expressed in terms of a single genetic component over the hybrids, but explicitly in terms of the GCA and SCA covariance structures ($\Sigma_G = 2 \cdot \Sigma_{gca} + \Sigma_{sca}$). This is worth re-emphasis. Potato has many traits are relevant for selection; many of them being complex traits with low heritabilities and interdependent relationships [@Gebhardt2013]. Because of this, it is critical for breeders to better utilize multivariate methods in genetic improvement in potato. In addition, hybrid breeding schemas are also augmented by multivariate methods whether based upon phenotype alone or also for multivariate genomic prediction applications [@Wang2017].

### Genomic prediction in hybrid potato

Genomic prediction has emerged as a cornerstone of modern crop breeding, offering unprecedented precision in estimating genetic merit by leveraging genome-wide marker data. By integrating molecular markers with phenotypic records, genomic prediction enables breeders to identify superior parental combinations and hybrid crosses with greater accuracy and efficiency than traditional pedigree-based methods. This section explores the application, advantages, and limitations of genomic prediction in hybrid potato breeding, drawing on insights from our experimental chapters to highlight its transformative potential for accelerating genetic gain.

:::{.content-hidden}

Crop improvement, like many activities, is dependent on well-informed and expedient decision-making. More than any other technology the past couple decades, genomic prediction is responsible for rapid gains in crop breeding. Before the advent of molecular marker information, the genetic value of a candidate could be predicted through the use of pedigree [@Henderson1973]. However, the utility of such an approach is quickly stymied in highly related populations or in shallow pedigreed populations. Only after the introduction of the first marker technologies 40 years ago, was more resolution possible making prediction of genetic value interesting in field crops [@Bernardo1994]. Particularly for hybrid crops, the application of genomic prediction is crucial for hastening genetic progress via modification of cycle length, ... [@Zhao2015b]. Relevant questions to the successful implementation of genomic prediction in a new crop include marker density, training set composition, and trait inspection.
:::

Multiple chapters in this thesis addressed genomic prediction applications in hybrid potato. In **chapter 3**, we built on the partitioned GCA and SCA models from **chapter 2** and incorporated molecular marker information to structure the each genetic component. Multiple genomic models were then tested in a predictive application testing  a simple and full genetic model (GCA, and GCA+SCA, respectively) for the same tuber variates from **chapter 2** along with tuber dry matter content. Testing the predictive model performance between each model showed no additional benefit through the addition of the SCA component in the model. Contrasting the SCA variance relative to the genetic residual suggested that there were other genetic effects that were not captured in either of the other genetic effects, most notably in total tuber number and dry matter content. Through this modelling schema, we were able to confirm that genomic prediction solely on the basis of GCA sufficed in the estimation of a hybrid cross genetic for all tuber variates studied.

These prediction models were extended further in **chapter 5** by examining several other statistical paradigms and assessing any benefits to multiallelic marker information. We drew our attention specifically to the utility of identity-by-descent (IBD) information derived from deep pedigree information linking ancestral founders to the parent's of hybrids along with multiallelic identity-by-state (IBS) information. Both types of marker information were compared with conventional biallelic SNPs using traditional shrinkage-based models along with more complicated kernel prediction. For all tuber variates, the SNP based prediction models were superior than their multiallelic counterparts. Marked differences in prediction accuracy were especially observed between the SNP and IBD models. Similarly, we found little differences between the different modelling methods, with exception that the Gaussian kernel tended to maximize prediction accuracy regardless of trait and markerset. These results would suggest that in the context of genomic prediction, simpler marker parameterizations tend to yield more consistent prediction outcomes. Despite these results,  multi-allelic marker information are likely to continue to have a prominent role in inferential applications such as multi-parental population (MPP) mapping [@Li2021a]. This utility will continue to advance potato genetics {TODO}.

### Methods of selection

 Modern breeding programs are met with unbounding choice with regard to different technologies. This is especially true for molecular marker and marker-based methods of selection. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) and other marker-based techniques have revolutionized modern breeding programs by enabling precise selection of desirable traits at early stages of development. In the context of hybrid potato breeding, these methods leverage molecular markers to identify and select parental lines with favorable alleles, thereby accelerating genetic gain.

The topic of selection strategy in hybrid potato was tackled in **chapter 4**. The primary exercise was to estimate the selection efficiency of our marker-assisted selection strategy (MAS), a linkage-based control (PC), and genome-wide prediction (GP) for the prediction of an inbred parent's breeding value. Based upon a forward-selection procedure, 33 unique QTL were found across three traits (total tuber number was excluded). These QTL were able to pick up between 54 and 56 per cent of the background genetic variation and were the primary basis for prediction in the MAS models. Examining prediction accuracy alone, the GP strategy was evidently for all phenotypes based upon the cross-validation strategy, though, MAS performed well despite accounting for only a fraction of the genetic variation. This chapter concluded with the incorporation of cost of molecular marker sampling which suggested a higher a higher selection efficiency per log cost for MAS over that of genomic prediction.

## Wider Implications

### Hybrid Breeding Schema

Two important questions broached in **chapter's 2 & 3** dealt with the nature of gene action in hybrid potato and what population and breeding strategy should be leveraged to effectively breed for complex trait improvement. Both of these questions impact the future of what _kind_ of hybrid crop potato might be. While the scope of this thesis is limited by the limited genetic background sampled to create these inbred populations [@Lindhout2018], we can still consider how these results might inform strategy for potato breeders considering hybrid schemas.

One of the major findings of the earlier chapters was a distinct lack of SCA variance found among the panel of 806 hybrids from **chapter 2**. This was further confirmed in **chapter 3** in a genomic model were SCA variance was similarly smaller in contrast to the other genetic effects. As remarked in these chapters, this would indicate a lack of non-additive gene action at work in this population of F1 hybrids for the probed tuber traits. This could be characteristic of very little population structure among the inbreds (as confirmed by the population-based analyses in **chapter 3**), however, this is not wholly satisfactory. It has been observed in other hybrid crops that SCA variance tends to be more important in complex trait architecture where heterotic pools are not genetically distinct [@Zhao2015b]. Contrary to this, our results follows Fisher's original observation where $V_d$ was treated as nothing more than a genetic residual in the parent offspring regression [@Bernardo2016]. This was evident both in the phenotypic analyses and predictive modelling of **chapter's 2 & 3**.

This naturally has ramifications in the structure of a breeding program. Looking first at genomic prediction, we likely need not consider higher-order genetic effects during model training. Models which either considered the additive component (GCAs in **chapter 3**) or the average genetic effect (the GW model in **chapter 4** and shrinkage-based models in **chapter 5**) tended to be the most reliable models for predicting hybrid performance. There is one caveat here which is the increased performance observed with the Gaussian kernel for the prediction of hybrid performance which marginally outpaced the other approaches in **chapter 5**.

### Pooling Methods

Perhaps most pertinent to hybrid breeding is with regard to pool structure and the necessity of multiple pools. The development of pools in crops like maize or sorghum was an unguided process where complementation between distinct genetic groups was first observed often with pedigree-breeding, and then further developed with more formal methods of population improvement [@Duvick2004]. Hybrid crops are primarily the product of a multi-pool system, however, this is dependent upon multiple conditions related both to complex trait improvement and the additional costs of logistics in multi-pool breeding. Multiple simulation studies have examined the topic of heterotic pool development and are worth our consideration. Simulation of both tetraploid and diploid breeding programs found that two pool strategy based around GCA-based selections were effective for a clonal diploid program, however, this was contingent on the degree of dominance in the trait and is widely known to be capital intensive [@Labroo2023].
The question of how pools should be generated is also open for debate. In terms of quantitative trait improvement, multiple _splitting_ strategies have been suggested to be equivalent including even random pool assignment, at least among selfing crops [@Cowling2020]. A more important consideration than genetic differentiation among pools in potato will be the market segment requirements. These will strongly govern pool development around trait targets which widely diverge between ware tuber and processed potato used in quick service restaurants as a matter of example [@Keijbets2008]. Rather than seeing heterotic pooling as some metaphysical necessity, it is instead the working out of a comprehensive strategy dependent on the affordable production of inbred lines, strong fertility characteristics, and a reliable cytoplasmic male sterility mechanism [@McGrath2018]. These are the core factors which are decisive to the choice of single, two, or multi-pool breeding schemas. The topic of fertility is considered further in [@sec-future].

### Multivariate applications for potato breeders {#sec-implications}

Multivariate methods, including index selection, offer transformative potential for crop breeding by enabling simultaneous improvement of multiple traits while delineating their genetic, environmental, and residual correlations. These approaches are particularly valuable in potato breeding, where traits such as tuber yield, quality parameters, and disease resistance often exhibit complex interdependencies. By integrating genetic covariances, breeders can design selection indices that maximize genetic gain across traits, thereby optimizing resource allocation and accelerating progress toward breeding objectives. While these methods have been widely adopted in other field crops, their application in potato remains under-explored.

To lend some credence to multivariate selection in potato, we can consider what multivariate selection would involve using the trait genetic covariances for GCAs from **chapter 2** (Figure \ref{fig:gca-coef-full-pairs}) together with their full phenotypic variance matrix ($\mathrm P$). Assuming the GCA variances estimated here would be roughly equivalent to those estimated from a test cross ($\mathrm {G} \approx \mathrm {V}_{gca}$) schema in a hybrid breeding program, we could estimate the selection response on inbred parents for future inbred development using the multivariate breeder's equation as expressed by @Lande1983. If we performed truncation selection on average tuber volume (s = 2 $cm^3$) and conducted inter-mating between selected candidates, then the expected selection response ($\mathrm R$) next test cross cycle could be estimated as:

```{R get-covariances}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
library(data.table)
library(glue)
#Get your variance components from the first chapter
vrs <- fread("./assets/VarianceComponentsFullModel.csv")
#extract trait 1 and trait 2 and component
tr <- c("TV", "TY", "TN")
#init matrix
m <- matrix(NA, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, dimnames = list(tr, tr))

#filter and prepare your variances
setnames(vrs, 1, "effect")
vrs <- vrs[effect != "units:trait!R"]
rgx <- "^(.*)!trait_(.*):(.*)$"
vrs[, c("eff", "tr1", "tr2") := tstrsplit(gsub(rgx, "\\1 \\2 \\3", effect), " ")
    ][, c("effect", "std.error", "z.ratio", "bound", "%ch") := NULL]
#Get the opposite side of diagonal
full <- rbind(vrs, vrs[tr1 != tr2, .(component, eff, tr1 = tr2, tr2 = tr1)])

#Get your matrices
vList <- lapply(split(full, full$eff), \(f) {
  m[f[, cbind(tr1, tr2)]] <- f$component
  m
})
P <- Reduce(`+`, vList)
G <- vList$`trait:dam`
Pinv <- solve(P)
S <- c(2, 0, 0)
R <- G %*% Pinv %*% S
#include univariate
vp <- P[1, 1]
vg <- G[1, 1]
h2 <- vg / vp
r <- h2*2

# do ungodly things to get your latex
#Get g text
Gtext <- paste0(apply(round(G, 2), 1, paste0, collapse = " & "),
                collapse = " \\\\ ")
#then P
Pinvtext <- paste0(apply(round(Pinv, 2), 1, paste0, collapse = " & "),
                   collapse = " \\\\ ")
#and S
stext <- "\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}"
#and finally R
Rtext <- paste0(apply(round(R, 2), 1, paste0, collapse = " & "),
                collapse = " \\\\ ")
#hella messy
lat <- glue("$$ \\mathrm {{R = G \\cdot P^{{-1}} \\cdot S}}$$
  $$ \\mathrm {{R}} = \\begin{{bmatrix}}{Gtext}\\end{{bmatrix}}\\cdot\\begin{{bmatrix}}{Pinvtext}\\end{{bmatrix}} \\cdot {stext} $$
  $$\\mathrm {{R}} = \\begin{{bmatrix}}{Rtext}\\end{{bmatrix}}$$")
lat
```

This would suggest a mean increase of about `r round(R[1], 1)` $cm^3$ in tuber volume next test cross with a minor increase in total tuber yield and little change in tuber number. Note that not only is this a more accurate estimate than the univariate case (`r round(r, 1)` $= h^2 s$), but we are also able to evaluate the impact on the other tuber variates. This is invaluable both in forecasting and breeding strategy development.More attention is needed here to make these methods more practical to wield as well as scalable in applied settings. With regard to practicality, selection indices are one of the primary tools used to reduce a breeder's multi-dimensional trait space into into a singular index with a variety of methods proposed [@Kempthorne1959; @Bulmer1981]. Speaking to implementability, the most challenging step in this process is the estimation of the trait genetic covariance. This tends to become quite unwieldy using traditional linear mixed modeling methods in higher-dimensional spaces making other methods more attractive [@Blows2009; @Runcie2013].

This same exercise has utility in other facets of potato breeding. One recurrent hurdle in potato evaluation is the lack of genetic correlation between the initial seedling stages and subsequent clonal generations [@Maris1988]. This is true both for phenotypic evaluation and genetic parameter estimation and all this significantly constrains early selection efficiency within potato breeding programs [@Davies1974; @Gopal1998]. Multivariate estimation of a candidate's _genetic value_ (relevant in clonal programs) or _breeding value_ (relevant for both clonal and hybrid breeding schemas) jointly across multiple generations could be a valuable extension of multivariate selection. With the genetic covariance of the seedling and clonal generations tuber yield (for example), the C1 or C2 yield could be estimated based on observing the seedling's yield. The estimation of these generational covariance structures together with a technology like genomic prediction could be a valuable extension in forecasting the potential of a candidate across generations.

### Successful genomic prediction in hybrid potato

Genomic prediction promises to accelerate genetic gain in multiple hybrid crops in the coming decades [@Labroo2021]. **Chapter's 3, 4, and 5** have several implications for genomic prediction applications in potato as a hybrid crop. Considering factors related to parameterization of genetic model or type of modelling framework (what we will call more generally, _model choice_), it is not the _decisive_ factor in the outcome of genomic prediction strategy. Having reviewed extensions of the traditional GBLUP, various shrinkage-based estimation methods, and one implementation of the Gaussian kernel, we found similar levels of performance with only marginal improvement between models. This is in keeping with many similar studies in other row crops as well as observed in tetraploid potato [@Sverrisdottir2017; @Endelman2018; @Amadeu2019; @Wilson2021a; @Schrauf2021]. Whether the model is an extension of GBLUP or a new member of the Bayesian alphabet, there is no clear or  distinct advantage observed for most traits.

As documented in other crops, often more important than the specific genetic parameterisations of a model is the actual composition of its training set [@Dias2019]. In many breeding programs, training sets often arise from the breeding material itself utilizing previous breeding cycles to estimate the population genetic covariance or marker effects for a genomic model. Within hybrid breeding schemas, training sets are frequently developed from test cross blocks which often have some factorial structure (e.g. **t** testers by **x** new candidates) or sparse modification [@Jarquin2020]. These are used both for the selection of novel lines within-pools as well as the scoping prospective crosses to aid intra and inter-pool improvement, respectively [@]. **Chapter's 3, 4, and 5** all utilized four field trials which utilized just under 800 F1 hybrids which were the progeny of 456 inbred parents in a sparse mating design. While we were able to demonstrate in an earlier chapter that the genetic models based upon these training sets were technically _identifiable_, the sparsity of the crossing block likely led to bias in the estimation of our genetic variances and of any predictions of the genetic effects [@Mohring2011]. Despite this, genomic prediction based upon this training set appeared possible even with a modest size. Aside from incorporating future cycles to augment, there are many optimization methods relevant to increasing the phenotypic and genetic variance in a training set [@Isidro2015; @Berro2019; @Ou2019].

Related to training set composition is the topic of molecular marker information density. These questions are often pursued along the lines of predictive benefits in genomic modelling, the hope being that all genetic variation can be interrogated by some perfect markerset. While this cannot be fully achieved [@Brachi2011], markerset composition is a worthwhile question in efficient selection applications. In **Chapter's 4**, we considered a procedure for comparing classical marker-assisted selection over genomic prediction for several quantitative traits. One of the primary conclusions of this research was that there are multiple complex traits in potato which could be affectively selected for with only a handful of molecular markers. This schema was relatively simple and could be augmented through a more robust simulation of costs, genotype-by-environment effects, and trial design [@Peixoto2024]. A point should also be made regarding our higher marker densities, that being, these were still quite low. Many predictive modelling studies have used marker densities in the magnitude of hundreds of thousands or million of molecular markers [@Druet2014; @Weber2024]. Having said this, even tetraploid studies have shown that small marker panels are still capable of yielding permissible results in genomic prediction and other trait discovery applications which is in keeping with what we observed throughout this thesis [@Aalborg2024; @Leyva-Perez2022].

Aside from marker density, molecular marker content has captured the attention of many geneticists. Whether it be the inclusion of functional genetic information, enrichment of major QTL, or multi-omic data, all seek to include biologically relevant information to bolster genetic applications [@Guo2016; @MacLeod2016; @Arouisse2024]. In this vein, **Chapter 5** attempted genomic prediction based upon multiallelic predictors through the inclusion of haplotag and IBD profiles. Strategies for the development of multiallelic probe design and genetic models have become a topic of interest in potato as an answer to potato's genomic diversity  [@Tang2022]. While recent pan-genome studies have shown less haplotype diversity among released potato varieties (particularly among European cultivars), potential applications for multiallelic molecular data are still to be identified [@Sun2025]. Statistical models developed with our haplotag probeset showed nearly identical performance with models using traditional SNP-based predictors. These results would suggest little benefit in the inclusion of multiallelic predictors for genome-wide prediction based upon our survey of models used. The performance of the IBD models were notably depressed relative to the other predictor groups, but noted already, this could be the product of high uncertainty for a subset of ancestral founders. Whether or not IBD information can extend genomic prediction applications, it is worthwhile to reiterate that founder composition in a breeding program can be utilized in pre-breeding efforts, understanding selection outcomes, and genetic diversity management.

## Future research {#sec-future}

There are still many facets of potato breeding which could be improved with further biometrical applications. We consider here the role of quantitative genetics for improved fertility, pre-breeding methodology, and breeding risk assessment for more robust potato breeding.

![(left) The classic breeder's equation where genetic gain is a linear function of selection intensity, selection accuracy, and the genetic standard deviation divided by the length of cycle and breeder's risk (right) which is the product of selection intensity, the compliment of selection accuracy, and the genetic by environment standard deviation divided by the number of trials.](./assets/selection_risk.pdf){#fig-risk width=80%}

Fertility is a crucial factor for any seed-based crop. This is especially true in hybrid breeding systems where often the cost price is dependent on an affordable and reliable seed production system [@Mao1998; @Longin2014]. Most research in potato fertility up until the time of writing has _rightly_ been focussed on large effect loci like _Sli_ or important genes in wider fertility modules like _StCDF1_ [@Clot2020; @Eggers2021; @Song2022]. As these loci continue to be used and fixed in breeding populations, an important future step will be to assess this broader array of traits in potato populations [@Kempe2011]. The typical targets for fertility in hybrid crops are pollen shed, sufficient pollen viability, and synced male and female flower opening, such that seed production is unencumbered [@Ortiz1997; @Longin2012]. This in conjunction with the development of key cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) strategies will be necessary to build a reliable seed production system in hybrid potato.

Pre-breeding is an often neglected topic in the genetic improvement of potato, especially in diploid-based programs. How novel tetraploids should be screened and incorporated into a diploid breeding program is not a straightforward process and is decorated by multiple hazards. In traditional crop breeding, if a new program is being initiated, evaluating a base population of landraces is a sensible trait improvement strategy [@Gorjanc2016]. However, in diploid populations, novel germplasm must first be subjected to angiogenesis or _prickle pollination_ before dihaploids are introduced into a program. Not only has the trait architecture of the original tetraploid donor been disrupted in the dihaploid, but these dihaploids often have little to no resemblance to them as well due to severe inbreeding depression. Genomic modelling has been proposed in the prediction of diploid performance based upon their relationship to phenotyped tetraploids, but this has shown little benefit thus far [@Wilson2021]. Considering the IBD estimation methodology used in **chapter 5**, here the potential of allele tracing methodology could aid breeders. If a novel donor has already been introgressed into a program, IBD profiles can leveraged and even extended to related tetraploids if molecular marker data is present though this would be a considerable endeavour. Lastly, multiple forward genetic approaches have been proposed in an effort to _design_ the ideal hybrid crop [@Wallace2018; @Zhang2021]. This has been proposed as the ideal method for pre-screening diploid candidates to monitor the degree of nonsense mutations early to hasten the process of inbreeding. Whether this approach can seed enough inbreds of sufficient population size is to be seen.

Often, while considering a novel technology or more efficient breeding schema, the first question asked is _"What kind of genetic gains can be expected with this implementation"_? This in of itself is not unsound, but without asking _"what are the risks of such an implementation"_ biometricians run the risk of overly optimistic forecasting. This addendum is especially pertinent for potato breeders due to many of the aforementioned challenges, chief among them, environmental sensitivity [@George2017]. Formalizing the estimation of explicit risk of a breeding strategy is the province of quantitative genetics and this deserves greater attention. To this end, we can conceptualize an analogue to the classic breeder's equation where the potential risk trade-offs associated with such a strategy are manifest ([@fig-risk]). For example, decreasing the cycle length of a schema by reducing the number of years of trial evaluation is a classic example for hastening genetic gain. However, this would also increase the risk or uncertainty around these candidates if you have exposed them to an insufficient number of environments. Embracing other tools might also bring risk to the forefront. Factor analytic and random regression models have been lauded for their ability to assess genotype stability and adaptability, and offer incredible potential for evaluation in potato [@Souza2020; @Smith2018]. Looking to methods utilized in the animal breeding world, hazard models could also be useful for assessing the long-term stability of a potential candidate [@Yazdi2002a].


This thesis has demonstrated the transformative potential of biometrical methods in advancing hybrid potato breeding. By interrogating the genetic architecture of hybrid populations, evaluating genomic prediction models, and assessing marker-based selection strategies, we have provided a robust framework for accelerating genetic gain in potato. Our findings underscore the importance of additive genetic effects (GCAs) in hybrid performance prediction, the efficiency of marker-assisted selection for major QTL, and the scalability of genomic prediction even with modest marker densities. These insights not only bridge critical gaps in potato breeding but also align with broader trends in crop improvement, where quantitative genetics and genomic technologies are reshaping traditional paradigms. Moving forward, the integration of these methods into breeding programs promises to enhance precision, reduce cycle times, and unlock the full potential of hybrid potato as a sustainable crop for future agriculture.
