# Outline

Hastened genetic progress in potato is dependent on the continued application of quantitative genetics methods in breeding programs. Like many vegetable crops, the application of statistical genetic theory has only received significant attention the past two decades in potato. Before this, complex trait improvement in conventional potato breeding was reliant on phenotypic selection and marked by several inefficiencies  including underpowered field evaluations and long release cycles. With the wider application of successful technologies that have had positive success in other field crops, higher success of potato improvement is possible. These include both methods such as variance component estimation, genomic prediction, selection index theory as well as breeding schemas like recurrent selection or line breeding.

In this thesis, we consider the conversion of clonal potato to a diploid hybrid crop as an exercise of applied biometrical methods. To our knowledge, this thesis is the first to interrogate the genetic architecture of a hybrid potato population and assess both features in these populations and the adequacy of specific statistical methods applied to them. This was the form that the questions posed throughout this thesis took. We first examined the genetical properties of the F1 hybrid seedling trials including genetic correlations between multiple tuber yield components (chapter 2; @Adams2022). We also considered the population structure of these hybrids with the introduction of inbred molecular marker information (chapter 3; @Adams2023) as well as with ancestral founder profiles (chapter 5). After having estimated these genetic parameters, we tested multiple predictive modelling methodologies testing the marginal gains of predicting dominance effects (chapter 3; @Adams2023), potential benefits of marker assisted selection for complex traits (chapter 4), and various multiallelic parameterisations for genome-wide regression (chapter 5). These topics cover an important range of topics for modern selection methods in a potato breeding program.

In this discussion, we provide a synthesis of the previous four experimental chapters with two major aims. We first wish to identify the most important findings of this research, and second, outline the direct implications of our research on potato more generally.

2. Summarising the past few chapters (6-8 paragraphs)

    ## Biometrical analysis of field trials

    i) Hybrid yield can be adequately represented by their parental combinations ( chapter 2)
         A. A core concept in hybrid breeding is the ability to assess the potential of hybrid crosses on the basis of parental value.
         B. Our statistical formulation allowed us to present genetic models which produce those breeding values and assess their capture on phenotypes of interest.
    ii) In hybrid potato populations, we can decompose genetic correlations into their predominately additive and dominance components (GCA and SCA as proxies) (chapter 2)
         A. The ability to estimate and assess genetic correlations represent important information for index selection, multi-selection response, and monitoring breeding population changes over time.

    ## Application of molecular marker information

    iii) These same models can be overlaid with marker data for genomic prediction/selection applications. (chapter 3)
         A. The ability to apply genomic prediction in a crop represents a major milestone in hybrid breeding. Because hybrid breeding tends to have longer release cycles, genomic prediction is necessary in hastening informed selection decisions.
    iv) Marker data showed little evidence of structure in population. (chapter 3)
    v) Multiple molecular selection strategies were viable for several traits (chapter 4).
    vi) Potential for multiallelic marker information in predictive modelling (chapter 5).
         A. We examined multiple forms of multiallelic marker information with a focus on differences between IBS and IBD based loci.

    ## Implications

3. Implications of these results (6 paragraphs)
    i) SCA is a genetic residual [@Bernardo2016] (chapter 2)
         A.  Not something worth trying to predict in diploids.
         B.  Using GCA's for selection in young potato populations.
         C. [@Labroo2024]
    ii) Tuber size and dry matter content are better candidates for selection than tuber number
         A.  Sensitivity of tuber number.
         B.  Larger residual variance
    iii) Multi-trait models a benefit for potato breeders. (Chapter 2)
         A.  Index selection can be of direct use to breeders.
         B.  Technical problems applying this in production.
    iv) Technologies like genomic prediction can be applied quite simply
         A.  Require smaller training set sizes relative to tetraploids
    v) Crossing schema for training set development (chapter 3).
         A.
    vi) Model choice is useful but not the most important factor for selection.
    vii) Multiallelism likely a benefit for major QTL, and little else
    viii) Flexibility in Spatial modelling.

    ## Future research

4. Future applications of statistical models (3 - 4 paragraphs)
    i) Multi-trait modelling to estimate genetic correlation between tuber generations
         A.  [@Gopal1998]: GCA does not appear to be very repeatable in early generations, suggesting that even family-based analyses do not give stable components across generations.
         B.  [@Davies1974]: Also examines the lack of suitability in selection in 1-hill stage
         C. [@Maris1988]: Excellent paper looking at the lack of correlation between seedling, first, and second clonal generations.
    ii) IBD founder tracing in pre-breeding generations in potato
         A.  Link to Genome Design [@Zhang2021].
         B.  Access and assessment of tetraploid material.

    iii) Genomic prediction as a vehicle for population change
         A.  You are driving selection of parent development
         B.  Hybrid prediction for coming cycles [@Zhao2015b].
    iv) Risk-based approach for estimating potato sensitivity.

## QTL: "_I know it when I see it_"

* It is widely understood that QTL mapping is only useful for turning up large variants and they in themselves cannot reconstitute all of the relevant heritable variation for a trait. Echoing other geneticists remarks on QTL mapping, _"all that glitters is not gold"_. However, as seen in these results they are not without some utility. They can be used for relatively accurate selection assuming that target populations are large enough.


* There are many reasons why a breeder might want to understand the nature of major variants in their breeding program.

* However, unless this is something that either disrupts normal biological processes (severe gametic selection), this likely doesn't need to be 

This can best be segmented into the categories of _nice to know_ and _need to know_. 

## Multiallelism: An unnecessary consideration?

- Breeding is more than just prediction. The use of information by a breeder is not confined to breeding value estimation. 

## Methods should provide insights

Very serious discussion about things.
