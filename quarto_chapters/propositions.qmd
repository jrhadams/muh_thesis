1. The same statistical models successfully utilized in other hybrid crops are amenable to diploid potato
\newline (this thesis)
2. Statistical genetics still forms a core domain for driving and evaluating genetic progress in new crops
\newline (this thesis)
3. Geneticists would be better served by rigorous testing of molecular markers over pattern-hunting expeditions in spread sheets.
3. Hybrid breeding is a tool which robs the use of innovation from the commons
4. The North American land-grant university model is an efficacous model for open agricultural research worthy of universal adoption. Public plant breeding institutions
4. Statistical models which can be leveraged both for inference and prediction should be preferred over those which only excel in the latter.
3.  Potato is just a vegetable crop masquerading as a field crop.
5. Higher education institutions play a vital role in upholding international law.
6. The Dutch are not remarkable for the number of sandwiches they eat, but rather for their lack of passion in their preparation and consumption.

* Most problems which the applied plant sciences attempt to address are political in nature rather than technical.
5. Attempting to incorporate high-dimensional biological information into predictive statistical models, _at best_, only leads to marginal benefits in crop breeding.
* Crop breeding, even in the age of artificial intelligence, will not change the substantially the formula of finding -> using -> regenerating

* If we truly care about the replication crisis in science, then insentive structures within universities, departments, and journals must be drastically changed. 

* The most ambitous breeding projects of the 20th century happened within the communist block rather than within privatised breeding companies.

* Breeding crops for climate change is like designing the perfect burger to ameliorate obesity.

* The problem is not that the Dutch enjoy sandwiches too liberally, but that the whole sandwich affair from preparation to ingurgitation is performed without so much as a modicum of passion.

* Geneticists are much too easily distracted by markers. Geneticist are much too easily fooled by markers. Sirens are to Sailers what markers are to Geneticists.

* More PhD's would finish on time if they received _a cut_ of the department distribution fund.

* More information content in a model does not necessarily make for better performance
4. Breeding _climate-ready_ crops is like designing _obesity-proof_ burgers
5. Putting more information into statistical models, _at best_, only leads to marginal benefits
