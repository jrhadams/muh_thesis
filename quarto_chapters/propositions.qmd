1. Diploid potato is amenable to a hybrid breeding system.
\newline (this thesis)
2. Statistical genetics still forms a core domain for driving, evaluating, & forecasting genetic progress in new crops 
\newline (this thesis)
3. Genetiscists are too distracted by molecular markers.
4. Breeding _climate-ready_ crops is like designing _obesity-proof_ burgers
5. Putting more information into statistical models, _at best_, only leads to marginal benefits
6. The problem with the Dutch is not how many sandwhiches they eat, but their deficit of passion in the whole affair.

* Crop breeding, even in the age of artificial intelligence, will not change the substantially the formula of finding -> using -> regenerating

* If we truly care about the replication crisis in science, then insentive structures within universities, departments, and journals must be drastically changed. 

* The most ambitous breeding projects of the 20th century happened within the communist block rather than within privatised breeding companies.

* Breeding crops for climate change is like designing the perfect burger to ameliorate obesity.

* The problem is not that the Dutch enjoy sandwiches too liberally, but that the whole sandwich affair from preparation to ingurgitation is performed without so much as a modicum of passion.

* Geneticists are much too easily distracted by markers. Geneticist are much too easily fooled by markers. Sirens are to Sailers what markers are to Geneticists.

* More PhD's would finish on time if they received _a cut_ of the department distribution fund.

* More information content in a model does not necessarily make for better performance
