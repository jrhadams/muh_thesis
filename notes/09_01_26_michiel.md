## Going over the introduction with michiel

I'm terrified about this meeting. I'm terrified about this chapter.

First 3 pages really nice

A gap that Michiel sees is that a few papers have to do with marker based breeding specifically in potato.

no new words discussed previously
.

We probably really need a figure here to show the difference between breeding ysstems.


Extend the modern potato breeding section. Include molecular marker before talking about challenges in potato breeding
