\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I begin by dedicating this thesis to the memory of my father, Shawn Jeffery Adams, and little sister, Erika Lane Adams. Losing you both has changed my state of conciousness and the void of your absence has only magnified with time. Paraphrasing the late David Lynch, \textit{"you have gone to whatever the next place is"}; \textit{"Death is just a change"}\footnote{A wonderful reflection of these words by the recently deceased Kaleb Horton: \url{https://kalebhorton.ghost.io/death-is-just-a-change/}}.

I want to thank my family for the strength you have given me through the research and writing of this thesis. Principally, \textbf{Flora}. You have been so patient
