\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to begin by dedicating this thesis to the memory of my father, Shawn Jeffery Adams, and little sister, Erika Adams. The loss of the both of you has forever altered my conciousness and the void left by your departure only magnifies as time advances. In the words of the late David Lynch, \textit{"you have gone to whatever the next place is"} and \textit{"death is just a change"}\footnote{A wonderful reflection of these words by the late Kaleb Horton can be found here: \url{https://kalebhorton.ghost.io/death-is-just-a-change/}}. In these words and Lynch's films I have found great comfort these past six years.

I want to thank my family for the strength you have given me through the writing of this thesis. Principally, \textbf{Flora}. You have been so patient
